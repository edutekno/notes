Abstract
The competence to perform an academic literature review task in a digital context is of paramount importance for higher education students. However, both undergraduate and graduate students have difficulty finding, analysing, and processing such information for their academic tasks. Recent studies propose a task-centred approach to teach relevant knowledge and skills to perform review tasks. This paper presents a quasi-experimental study on the effects of an online task-centred course on the IPS skills development and self-efficacy perception of 80 graduate students in educational sciences. The Information Problem Solving (IPS) and Four-Component Instructional Design (4C/ID) models have been applied for course design and development. The results indicate that, after the course, students in the experimental group outperformed the control group on planning and search activities. These students also seemed to do better at defining research questions and processing the information found, though these results were not statistically significant. Finally, no differences were found related to the ability to present information. In addition, self-efficacy related to the IPS skills needed to perform an academic literature review task developed positively in the experimental group. Implications for instruction on these IPS skills in higher education are discussed.
Introduction
In contemporary education, the ability to manage digital information is essential to learning. Students at all levels are exposed to increasing amounts of digital data, which requires skills for handling them effectively and efficiently (European Commission, 2018). In higher education, we expect students to be able to manage the exponential growth of the information available online (Deja et al., 2021). However, contemporary research has shown that students at all educational levels often lack the ability to use digital information in an appropriate way (Walraven et al., 2008; Zhou & Lam, 2019). They do not become expert information problem solvers by intensive internet use only, but need explicit instruction to reach that status (Rosman et al., 2016c; Salmerón et al., 2017; Weber et al., 2019).
Wopereis et al. (2015, 2016) showed that undergraduate students in educational sciences benefited from task-centred instruction (see Francom, 2017; Van Merriënboer, 2007) on information problem solving (IPS) skills relevant to performing literature reviews for a master's thesis. Such instruction includes a variety of learning tasks that are based on authentic, professional tasks (in this case ‘conducting literature reviews’). The current study examines the effects of a similar type of instruction on review ability using different measurements in a different context (students from various Spanish-speaking countries). As such, it aims to expand our knowledge on effective, efficient, and appealing IPS instruction (cf. Brand-Gruwel & Wopereis, 2006; Dolničar et al., 2016; Frerejean et al., 2019; Garcia & Badia, 2017; Pifarré & Argelagós, 2020). In our study, we present the improvement of IPS skills to perform an academic literature review task by means of a formal online course. We also report on the enhancement of perceived self-efficacy related to those skills, because this can serve as a complementary and valuable measure to reveal the development of complex IPS skills (Rosman at al., 2015). The course can be characterized as task-centred instruction and was constructed using design guidelines that are central to the Four-Component Instructional Design (4C/ID) model (Van Merrienboer & Kirschner, 2018).
The process of finding and managing information in online academic databases in order to construct knowledge requires the competence to search for the appropriate information in reliable online sources and integrate this information in a significant way with existing knowledge. This ability or complex cognitive skill is often referred to as information literacy (IL) or information problem solving (IPS).
The Association of College and Research Libraries defines IL as a set of skills to search for, assess, and use information that is necessary to solve information problems (ACRL, 2016). In addition, this association presents a framework that includes a variety of competency standards for higher education. Thus, an information literate individual should be able to: (1) determine information needed; (2) access the needed information in an effective and efficient way; (3) assess information and its sources critically and incorporate selected information into one's knowledge and values; (4) use information effectively to accomplish a specific purpose; (5) understand the economic, legal, and social issues surrounding the use of information, and access and use information in an ethical and legal manner.
This collection of skills reflects the IPS model (Brand-Gruwel et al., 2005, 2009; Dinet et al., 2012; Frerejean, Velthorst, et al., 2019; Raes et al., 2012). This model shows that (a) the constituent skills necessary to execute steps in the IPS process have strong ties (Garcia & Badia, 2017) and (b) regulation skills such as planning, monitoring, and evaluation are essential to IPS (Winne, 2019). The IPS model depicts five constituent skills that are all related to steps in the IPS process: (1) defining the problem, (2) searching for information, (3) scanning information, (4) processing information, and (5) organizing and presenting information found. In addition, each constituent skill is subdivided into several sub-skills; for instance, defining the problem involves the sub-skills of reading and understanding the assignment, activating prior knowledge, determining the needed information, and formulating driving questions that could lead to a better search.
In higher education, the overall IPS process is crucial to learning tasks that include a systematic review of scientific literature (Birkett & Hughes, 2020; Wopereis et al., 2015). Research shows that students do not merely acquire this skill by browsing the web, but that explicit instruction is necessary (Badia & Becerril, 2015; Wopereis et al., 2008). Studies indicate that students who are now entering the higher education system need ample instructional support to learn IPS in a scientific context (Brand-Gruwel et al., 2005; Donnelly et al., 2018; Frerejean et al., 2018, 2016; Henkel et al., 2018; Hinchliffe et al., 2018; Kirschner & van Merriënboer, 2013; Lanning & Mallek, 2017; Mahmood, 2016; Smith et al., 2013).
Fig. 1 shows the IPS skill decomposition that serves as a basis for this study. The constituent skills are equivalent to the IPS model of Brand-Gruwel et al. (2005), but they are grouped in a slightly different manner, based on the validation study of the PIKE-E test (Garcia et al., 2020), as explained in section 2.2. The first constituent skill is defining research questions, which consists of the knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed to analyse the topic of interest, activate prior knowledge on that topic, and formulate research questions related to the selected topic. The second constituent skill relates to planning search strategies, which is needed to prepare the search and includes actions such as determining the information needed, specifying the search terms, and selecting a search strategy. This includes using a thesaurus to find adequate keywords, using Boolean operators to specify a query, and deciding which scientific databases to use (e.g., ERIC, PsycINFO, SSCI, or Google Scholar). The third constituent skill is devoted to searching and locating sources necessary to answer the research questions that were formulated. This involves the execution of search queries planned above and generally checking the reliability and content of sources before deciding to access them.
The fourth constituent skill relates to selecting sources and processing information. This includes (a) selecting adequate and useful sources to answer the research questions, and (b) assessing, storing, and organizing the relevant information of the sources, by means of summaries that include references, key points, and arguments for why the sources are considered relevant. This constituent skill also includes the analysis and extraction of relevant information from the selected texts and the integration of the information found with prior knowledge. Finally, the fifth constituent skill encompasses presenting information, which includes the planning and execution of scientific writing processes.
In (applied) science, IPS commonly refers to searching and synthesizing the results of peer-reviewed research on a specific topic that is documented in scientific literature. It constitutes the literature review task, which is usually the starting point of research, development, and innovation projects. In large-scale projects, it can be a recurrent task. Literature review tasks vary in complexity according to the nature of the subject (new topic versus well-researched topic), a researcher's prior knowledge of a subject (high versus low topical knowledge), the methods used to collect, synthesize, and present the results (standard versus sophisticated ones), and constraints related to task execution (high versus low financial and human resources). Based on complexity, one can broadly divide literature research tasks into traditional, systematic, and meta-analytical instances (Jesson et al., 2011). Our study focuses on instructional design for learning a set of tasks that belong to the first two categories.
Many contemporary instructional theories and models that guide educationalists through the process of designing instruction for complex cognitive skills, like conducting a literature review, are holistic by nature (Francom, 2017; Merrill, 2002; Reigeluth & An, 2021; Van Merriënboer, 2007). They are often referred to as task-centred and aim at the development of instruction that supports the learning of an integrated knowledge base that prospective professionals need in order to perform a wide variety of future authentic tasks. Such instruction increases the potential for transfer of learning.
Francom (2017) introduced the concept of task-centred instruction (TCI) to emphasize the key principle of design which says that learning is centred around whole tasks that are based on real-world (professional) tasks. This holistic view of instructional design helps to prevent compartmentalization and fragmentation in educational programmes as it aims at designing instruction that facilitates the integration of knowledge, skills, and attitudes in an interconnected flexible knowledge base (Van Merrienboer & Kirschner, 2018). Other design principles that make up TCI are (a) activation of prior knowledge, (b) demonstration/modelling, (c) application, and (d) integration/exploration (Francom, 2017). Merrill (2002) labels these five design principles the ‘first principles of instruction’ and indicates that Van Merriënboer's Four-Component Instructional Design (4C/ID; Van Merrienboer & Kirschner, 2018) model best adheres to them. It is this instructional design model that was chosen as the premise for designing the intervention in the current study.
As a paragon of task-centred instructional design, the 4C/ID model emphasises the importance of taking whole task instruction as the point of departure for the design process. This is reflected in the ten-step design approach proposed by Van Merrienboer and Kirschner (2018) that accompanies 4C/ID, where designing comprehensive learning tasks based on authentic (professional) tasks is the first design step. For an extensive overview of the design steps needed to design the main components of task-centred instruction, we refer to Van Merrienboer and Kirschner (2018). In this section, we will restrict ourselves to an explanation of the four components that constitute good IPS instruction, in order to provide insight into the content of the course (see Sections 2.3.3 Course materials, 2.3.4 Online course).
The 4C/ID model highlights four components that are necessary to create an educational programme for complex skill learning. These components are: (1) learning tasks, (2) supportive information, (3) procedural information, and (4) part-task practice (Frerejean et al., 2021; Frerejean, Van Merriënboer et al., 2019; Van Merriënboer, 2007; Van Merrienboer & Kirschner, 2018).
Learning tasks are the backbone of such a programme and refer to cases, projects, professional tasks, or assignments. Learning tasks are rooted in authentic tasks and are presented to learners in simulated (school sites, online courses, multimedia programmes) or real-life environments (workplace). Performing a varied set of learning tasks results in inductive learning. Ideally, this set is offered sequentially from simple to complex with incrementally decreasing support and guidance (scaffolding). Learning tasks require both non-routine and routine skills.
Supportive information helps students to perform the non-routine aspects of learning tasks, which require problem solving, reasoning, and/or decision making. This kind of information is often called ‘the theory’ and is presented to students as paper-based and/or digital (online, multimedia) textbooks, handbooks, and resources such as white papers, journal articles, and encyclopaedic reference works. Methods for presenting supportive information aim at the construction of knowledge in a process that is called elaboration.
Procedural information, the third component, is needed to learn the routines that are part of task performance. Because it is offered to students at the moment it is needed during task performance, it is also called ‘just-in-time information’. Methods used to learn procedural information enhance a learning process that is called rule formation. Part-task practice is the final component of the 4C/ID model. This component also focuses on learning routines, but those that require a high degree of automatization. Instructional methods include excessive repetition that results in strengthening cognitive rules in long-term memory, in order to form routines that are similar across different tasks. These ‘if–then’ structures guarantee that similar responses are appropriately executed in similar contexts. This contributes to the automaticity of routines.
Van Merrienboer and Kirschner (2018) outlined a ten-step procedure for designing instruction according to the aforementioned four components. Both the 4C/ID model and the ten steps to complex learning have been applied to design instruction for obtaining IPS proficiency (Costa et al., 2021; Frerejean, Van Merriënboer et al., 2019).
Self-assessments are frequently used when measuring information literacy and IPS skills (Walsh, 2009). Although self-assessment by itself does not warrant that the perception of achievement is equal to actual achievement (see Young et al., 2019), measuring self-efficacy could be highly valuable as a complement in the development of complex IPS skills (Rosman et al., 2015). A self-assessment is a promising instrument because:
•
the subjective ability to assess self-efficacy is often a motivation for performance (Bandura, 2010; Deja et al., 2021; Ozkal, 2019) and can help students to persist with tasks, in particular when they are experiencing difficulties (Schunk, 1984; Wedderhoff et al., 2018);
•
assessment of one's skills and performance can positively influence subsequent performance (Spisak, 2018), as individuals can easily identify their strong and weak points, in a metacognitive way, and therefore better regulate their process (Boud, 1995; Lew et al., 2010);
•
self-assessments might be a useful tool for learning and self-reflection (Dochy et al., 1999; Doyle et al., 2019; Spisak, 2018); there are some aspects of information literacy that are more difficult to measure by achievement tests, such as regulation activities -i.e., they imply thoughts, feelings, and reflection about one's own actions, which are well known to the individual (Zimmerman, 2000)-, but that are well suited to examination by means of self-assessment tests (Falchikov, 2005; Oscarson, 1989).
Considering these four reasons, IPS self-assessments also have the potential to be a useful complement to other instructional strategies. Measuring self-efficacy related to IPS or IL with self-assessment instruments can make students aware of their deficiencies, which can be beneficial for the learning and development of IPS skills.
Rosman et al. (2015) recommend that researchers and practitioners include self-assessments when investigating students’ information literacy skills, due to the advantages mentioned above. They suggest administering self-assessments after ability tests, because of the potential for metacognition and regulation of the self-assessment instruments, and they strongly recommend not to assess those skills with self-reports alone, as an alternative to performance tests. In the study by Spisak (2018), for instance, which compared self-efficacy and performance tests, some secondary students overestimated their information literacy abilities. However, self-assessment was administered before the performance test, which could be a factor in diminishing the adequacy of the results of the self-assessment. Other studies used a self-report alone (e.g., Whitelock-Wainwright et al., 2020) and acknowledged the limitations of relying solely on self-report measures and the need to use more objective data.
The present study investigates the effect of task-centred instruction, with whole and authentic tasks, on higher education students' IPS skills development. Specifically, the intervention aimed at improving the students’ skills to review scientific literature in order to perform an academic task in a digital context.
Therefore, this study aims to answer the following two questions:
RQ1

Does task-centred instruction improve the IPS skills needed to carry out an academic literature review task in an online higher education environment?
RQ2

What is the effect of task-centred instruction on IPS self-efficacy expectations?
Considering the empirical findings available so far, it can be predicted that the task-centred instruction informed by the IPS and 4C/ID models will be effective in enhancing the complex skills needed to use digital information for academic purposes. More precisely, it is expected that the students receiving this training will obtain significantly better scores on the IPS skills test than the students who do not receive it. Additionally, we hypothesize that these students’ self-efficacy expectations on their ability to review scientific literature for academic purposes will be greater than students without training.
