your brain is 12.5 times more likely to

believe my gesture over my words and

that's because it is very hard to lie

with our gestures for example you want

to do little experiment with me sure

okay I want you to say five but hold up

the number three five hard right yeah I

had to think about them separately this

is why Liars use less gestures but no

tool like that is critical if you're

trying to set yourself up for success

and we're going to go through all of

them oh yeah Vanessa van Edwards is a

behavioral investigator who science back

research from body language and micro

Expressions to vocal tones and first

Impressions has revolutionized the way

we build confidence and create more

authentic relationships in every social

and professional interaction I'm a

recovering awkward person and I thought

that Charisma was genetic and I didn't

know how to have conversations I didn't

even know how to have friends then I

discovered that highly successful people

speak a hidden language and that is the

language of cu's this directly from the

research they know that blueprints will

talk to anyone they know that if you sit

within 25 ft of a high performer your

own performance improves by 15% and that

there's a direct correlation between

confidence and anxiety and the distance

p shoulder and our ear Lo so interesting

they also know that 82% of our

impressions of people are based on

warmth and competence so if you worry

that people don't take you seriously you

have trouble getting raises you feel

anxious and overwhelmed I have five

power cues for competence but if you

have ever been told you're intimidated

hard to talk to I want you to use these

five warmth cues

first what about how to get a partner in

terms of cues and body language let's

start with a study that blew my mind

it's impossible to be attracted to

someone who that's so crazy just such a

small little

thing this has always blown my mind a

little bit 53% of you that listen to the

show regularly haven't yet subscribe to

the show so could I ask you for a favor

before we start if you like the show and

you like what we do here and you want to

support us the free simple way that you

can do just that is by hitting the

Subscribe button and my commitment to

you is if you do that then I'll do

everything in my power me and my team to

make sure that this show is better for

you every single week we'll listen to

your feedback we'll find the guest that

you want me to speak to and we'll

continue to do what we do thank you so

much

[Music]

much Vanessa van

Edwards for someone that's just clicked

on this conversation now and they're

wondering why they should stay and

listen to what we're going to talk about

what would you say to

them very highly successful people speak

a hidden language and that is the

language of cu's if you don't know how

to read the cues people are sending to

you if you don't know how to control the

cues you're sending to others you are

missing a crucial element of success

how do you quantify that in a way that I

know that it's true are there studies or

stats that reinforce what you've just

said 82% of our impressions of people

are based on warmth and

competence that means that if we can

control our warmth cues and our

competence cues we know we are taking

care of 82% of our impression and that

is critical to being more memorable to

being more confident having clearer

communication and taking that a bit

further what areas of my life will that

as impact so if I'm warm and I'm

competent which you're telling me are

things that I can control what are the

downstream consequences of that so I

think my mission is to tackle a big lie

and that is that smart people will

translate their book smarts into people

smarts but actually you're no matter how

smart you are if you do not know how to

communicate with people you can't

connect with people you can't have good

relationships you can't have supportive

friendships you get looped into

difficult people or toxic people you

have trouble getting raises or

promotions when you are able to control

your communication it helps you not be

overlooked not be misunderstood and that

affects your friendships your partner

your career and also helps you feel more

confident walking into a room and what

is your research based on are you a

researcher have you done sort of

first-party research yourself where were

you drawing from so I'm a recovering

awkward person so I used to believe that

you were either born with Charisma or

you weren't that Charisma was genetic

and in 2002 I discovered a study that

changed my life which said that Charisma

can be

learned this is when I started to tackle

to figure out okay if Charisma can be

learned how do we learn it how can we

learn blueprints for conversation how

can we learn Frameworks for how we

connect and how we socialize that's when

I started doing my own research so I'm a

behavioral researcher and a bestselling

author on communication and I specialize

and helping very brilliant very smart

awkward folks not be overlooked and give

me some sort of depth as to the amount

of research and the quantity of research

that you've done how many people you

studied how many hours of footage Etc

yep so I uh developed my first framework

about 12 years ago and we've helped

400,000 students learn that framework

Master it and Conquer awkwardness or

feel more confident some of those folks

had very professional goals like getting

raised or promotion other folks were so

socially an anxious and so awkward they

couldn't make friends other people were

looking for their soulmate or their

partner and so 400,000 students have

told me that this framework Works nobody

teaches us this stuff

today or actually extroverts tend to

teach it so I read the quintessential

How to Win Friends and Influence People

back in the day and that's a wonderful

book but it's a book written by an

extrovert if you are not naturally

extroverted I'm not naturally

extroverted I'm more Amber verted it is

very hard to learn how to communicate if

you don't naturally gravitate towards

people I was like there has to be a way

to teach introverts and Everts to be

able to feel confident without having to

fake it till you make it

without having to pretend to be

extroverted or outgoing to be taken

seriously or to be

charismatic what's an Ambert so Amber

verts get energy from the right people

in the right places so for example in

this interview I love one-on-one

conversations I feel myself but if we

were to go to a loud bar or a nightclub

I would completely shut down and want to

be alone Amber verts can dial up

extroversion to hit their goals so if

they know they have to be friendly and

meet people for an interview or a

position they can do it but they need

lots of recharge time the reason why

it's important to know if you're an

Amber vert is because you should know

what are the people and places that

drain you there are certain people when

you open your calendar and you look at

it and you're like oh I have to be with

that person that is someone that drains

you they do not bring out your

extroversion or your natural love of

people there are also certain people who

you feel you could talk to for hours

they give you social energy they charge

your social battery so the very first

thing I have students do is sit and make

a list who are the people who give you

energy who charge you up who are the

people who take from you those are

people that we want to put boundaries

around we want to say no to we want to

limit as much as possible and then also

the places where do you thrive is it

conferences one-on-one business or is it

friends socializing parties knowing

those places helps you optimize your

social battery and when you say cues

which you said at the start of this

conversation people think of just body

language is that the sort of full extent

of areas that you focus on yes so there

so there cues come into four different

channels there is body language that's

facial expressions gestures posture but

there's also vocal so vocal cues are the

tone of our voice our Pace our volume

our Cadence there's also the words we

use obviously verbal cues the types of

words that I'm choosing to use are

signaling my warmth and competence to

you and the last the smallest channel is

our ornaments the colors we wear the

jewelry we wear the way we wear our hair

way we wear your facial hair those are

also signaling different things or

queuing people to feel a certain way

about you and what about what we say mhm

because I know you're writing a book

about I don't know if I can leak this

but here we go yeah can you're writing a

book about conversation so what we say

so I did not realize how powerful our

words are and here's a study that really

changed the way I think about this very

simple study they brought people into

the lab and they sold them up into two

different groups in one group they said

today you're going to play the community

game and they played kind of a prisoners

dilemma type of game the second group

they came into the same room the same

researcher they said good morning today

you're going to play the Wall Street

game the trick was the games were

exactly the same there was no difference

between the two games what they found

was everyone who was told they were

playing the Wall Street game shared an

average of one-third of their profits

everyone who was told they were playing

the community game shared an average of

two-thirds of their profits this means

that that one word Community game

Community made people think and feel

more about community and made them act

more collaboratively this means means

that the words we're using in our emails

our subjects our texts our LinkedIn

profile headlines are queuing people for

how they should treat us one really

simple way to think about this is your

calendar I send out calendar invites

multiple times a week to clients to

friends when we have meeting one-on-one

call video interview I'm being queed for

nothing those words are so overused

they're sterile if you add cues that

Prime people to feel or think a certain

way you're actually setting them up for

Success so 2025 wins collaborative

session strategy meeting goal meeting

goal overview teamwork collab session

those words are actually queuing that

person's brain every single time they

open their calendar that when we read

the a word like collaborate we are

literally more likely to be

collaborative so the words that we use

even one single word can actually change

the way people

think it's funny because our entire

lives are people like the difference

between me being a president prime

minister superb salesperson exceptional

entrepreneur is probably just my

understanding of other people and how I

show up in my words and my cues and so

when you think about it like that this

could be for many people the most

important subject for them to improve

upon I would even go further and say if

you don't have people skills you cannot

succeed you cannot succeed in life you

cannot succeed in love you cannot

succeed in business it doesn't matter

how smart you are you need people to

have success so this is I think the most

fundamental skill that people can invest

in and how many people did you say

you've taught people skills to 400,000

students and is there a particular case

study that you stands out to you as

being the most extreme in terms of case

studying the fact that someone can go

from zero to a wonderful place yes and

it's my very brilliant but stoic

students so I've noticed especially over

the last 10 years I've been been doing

this for about 17 years in the last 10

years especially my most extreme

students are the students who are very

very smart very talented and good at

what they do but they don't know what

cues to send and so they completely shut

down they try to become stoic unreadable

they try to have no facial expressions

they literally try to poke her face all

the time and as they try to make

connections made a partner make friends

people don't like them people don't

trust them they can't get bu to their

ideas and those are the students where I

see the biggest transformation they

don't realize that muting muting your

cu's is a danger zone que if you try to

be stoic and unreadable people literally

cannot get a read on you and so my

biggest Transformations have happened

when I can say you don't need to hide

your true feelings it's about amplifying

them with the right cues there's a

famous example of this uh Jamie simonoff

founder of ring so I don't know if you

ever watch Shark Tank yeah so in this

episode for those who haven't seen it

Jamie simoff entered the tank and

pitched a billion doll idea literally a

billion dollar idea because it went on

to raise funding from Sha and Richard

Branson but in the tank he pitches the

idea and he gets so much push back and

so much negotiation and he walks out of

the tank without a deal in fact the

Sharks did not like him what happened he

had the billion billion dollar idea but

he did not know how to share it this is

the biggest transformation I see is

people who have brilliant ideas they're

good people they're hardworking people

and they cannot get byy in they cannot

make friends they cannot find partners

how do they feel so if you had to say

words that make them feel seen right now

how are they feeling as they're

listening to this

overwhelmed getting into interaction

just social overthinking not knowing

what to do not knowing what to feel

underestimated like people don't see you

or the real potential that you have a

lack of confidence and fear afraid that

if you are your true self or you try any

of the things we're talking about people

won't like you and I want to teach you

that you can be yourself and you can be

liked and you can find your people and

that doesn't mean everyone's going to

like you but it means if you signal the

right things cues tell others how to

treat you if you signal the right cues

you will find your people one of the

things that I was sort of inferring from

what you said is the importance of

understanding your resting face

that's like the term we use in the UK

resting face which is like when

you're just listening or doing nothing

like how does your face look yes and

you're telling me that's really really

important it's real so I call it resting

bothered face

resting father face RBF same thing okay

this is a real phenomenon which is that

all of us have different faces at rest

now I want you to look at my face for a

second my face at rest I'm I'm going to

rest it for a second my mouth angles

down and sort of an upside on you so it

looks like this you see how these are

going down

yeah are you laughing at my you a little

bit okay so at rest I look a little sad

yeah that is just my mouth at rest yours

goes pretty straight across I just I

just you have a lot of hood that's what

that's called a lot of hood this is Hood

yes yes so that probably makes you do

people think you're angry or tired both

both okay people never call me angry

they call me sad you need to look in the

mirror and figure out what is the

default of your face if you're mouth

angles down into a frown people are

going to think you're sad you're going

to have to be counteracting that with

your cues if you have a lot of hood

above your eyes or you have these two

vertical lines that appear between your

eyebrows you actually don't have them

but if some of people at rest even had

those two lines people are going to

think you're angry or frustrated if you

have down eyes so I don't know if you

noticed but my I have cat I've added Cat

makeup to my eye ah yes yes that

actually makes me look less less sad

because also my eyes slope a little bit

down at the end which makes me look sad

okay so people often are like are you

okay are you tired I'm like no that's

just my face so I have ways that I

counteract it one I get to use makeup

which is a a great thing but second I

know that I need to make my face a

little bit more up right so when I am in

ING with someone when I'm on video when

I'm interview I typically rest my face

in an upward position I've activated

these muscles so don't I look happier

you do but you have have you got to

consciously tell yourself to do that or

do you just always remember no I have to

consciously tell myself to do that now I

only need to do that with people with a

first impression or when I'm trying to

make a good impression my team knows

that I'm not sad right like my team they

see me all the time they see without

makeup they know that I'm not sad they

know that's just my face so here's

what's critical one you should know what

is your resting default are you looking

sad angry or afraid I afraid I didn't do

so if you have um you actually have some

I'm so sorry oh you're I'm so sorry I'm

so sorry you have these lines some in

the one of my team just left in the back

so you have them just right here these

light lines here so um when we're afraid

we go and we raise our eyebrows up and

our you can't see it because I have

Botox on my forehead but um if you yeah

there you go there you go that's no no

open your eyes and go that's afraid so

the more you have those lines and the

whites of your eyes appear like have you

ever seen someone kind of walk around

like a deer in the headlights yeah they

make you feel anxious like if I were to

do my entire interview a little bit

wide-eyed you would not only feel

anxious but you wouldn't believe what I

was saying so you all should see if you

have this default lines or if the whites

of your eyes show look at your profile

pictures in your profile pictures here

are the three biggest mistakes you will

make one they're showing for your eyes

yeah yeah so people you are signaling

accidentally anxiety so try to make sure

you're not showing the upper whites

second mistake you will do is they make

a contempt micro expression so that's

one-sided mouth raise so just do a

one-sided mouth raise for me does it

make you kind of feel like better don't

do it for too long so if you do it at

home you'll there's a facial feedback

hypothesis when you make these faces it

actually triggers the emotion just like

when you have the emotion it triggers

the face there's a loop that happens so

if people make the contempt expression

one said in mouth rais not only do they

look scornful kind of disdained they

actually begin to feel better then and

scornful so do not do an asymmetrical

smile in your profile picture you are

accidentally signaling NE negativity the

third biggest mistake you will make is

they uh you do an inauthentic smile in

their picture the only true indicator of

Happiness is when these cheek muscles

are activated anyone can fake smile this

is what mine looks

like but you see people do it right yeah

I do it yeah and people know I would

rather you not no CU I I just don't have

a good smile what look like what I am I

going to say no it's it's horrible is do

you know I don't have your smile I

literally have to do this when I take

facez that's my smile I can't do the te

thing I try to what am I going to do

well you can smile without your teeth as

long as it hits your upper cheek muscle

so try just try this for me put your uh

pen or your finger in between your mouth

like this and smile as high as you can

go oh that's better that reaches all the

way up into your eyes do you see oh no

not that looks so much better okay if

you can activate these muscles in your

profile picture you don't have to walk

around like that but if you can act not

the fear not the fear just here just

here if you can activate these muscles

in your profile picture it shows

authentic happiness or don't smile at

all I hate the

advice just smile more fake Smiles do

not work Dr Barbara wild studied this

she took pictures of people thinking of

something they were authentically happy

about took a picture of them smiling

then she told them to fake smile and

took a picture of them on the surface

you really couldn't tell the difference

between the two smiles they looked very

similar but she had participants take

mood tests then look at the picture look

at one picture or the other group a

group b people who saw the positive

picture had an improved mood they caught

the happiness from the photo people who

looked at the fake smile had no mood

change this means I would rather you

have no smile at all or be neutral than

fake smile but if you can smile in your

picture it is so great for authentic

happiness it sounds like it might be

quite exhausting for some people because

I think some people although they

they're happy they feel good they're

nice people

they do have that resting bothered face

I think you called it and there's other

people that I know that just kind of

walk through life with this like resting

smile yeah like we can all think of that

person that's just like always happy

yeah and then there's these other people

who are like objectively happy too but

they just have that resting bed face so

it feels like life is going to be more

exhausting for those people you know I

think it's about choosing your heart

right it is hard it is exhausting for me

to show up to a meeting when I'm in a

good mood and have someone be like are

you sad and tired are you okay I'm like

I'm fine I find that exhausting is it

also a little exhausting to make sure

that in my first impression I'm being a

little bit more up with my face open

eyes wide and open mouth a little less

exhausting than that so I think you have

to choose what are the cues you're going

to purposefully add there are 97 cues

I've narrow down 97 that I think are the

most important you get to make your own

recipe you don't have to do all the cues

if smiling is not your thing smiling is

not essential for being charismatic when

we talk about being charismatic it's

about being warm and competent

and you have 97 cues to choose from to

make that warmth and competence recipe

and so you don't have to be a bubbly

extrovert to be charismatic you can be a

quiet powerful introvert you can be a

compassionate empathetic healer those

look different and so I think it's less

exhausting to find your recipe and to

use those cues a lot like there are

certain cues in my book that I teach

that I don't use they just don't feel

natural to me but there are other cues

where I'm like I really like this has

anyone ever done any really compelling

studies on this idea of resting

face or resting bothered face as you

call it there is research on resting

bothered face and there are certain

people who when people see pictures of

their face at rest they assume a mood

change in other words when there are

certain people at rest where you look at

them they look neutral but there are

certain a certain percent of the

population when you look at them they

look angry sad or afraid so it's real

people you look at and they look happy

and make you happy very few people have

happy resting face though you either

look neutral or bothered so you said you

were a recovering awkward person yes

take me into what you were like oh and

what do you mean when you say awkward

person I really wanted to go it alone I

was really overwhelmed by people and

interactions I didn't know what to do

with my hands I didn't know what to say

I felt like I missed a memo that

everyone got on

conversation I always felt like I was

saying the wrong things I had all these

awkward silences and then what would

happen is I would try to overcompensate

by sharing a ridiculous story or talking

too much or completely shutting down and

I kind of like wavered between

completely shutting down and being

overwhelmed and talking too much and

saying too much and just verbal vomiting

all over everyone and so I shut down and

in college especially I just felt so

left out I just felt so lonely and I

don't know if anyone watching is feeling

lonely I thought it was all my fault I

was like I miss the memo I don't know

how to have conversations I don't even

know how to have friends that's what it

felt like that I desperately wanted to

make connections but I had no idea how

to level up a new person to a

friendship I had no idea how that path

happened I had no idea how to have a

conversation with someone share

something real and then have a real

interaction back and so it was really

lonely and

overwhelming and what was the cist for

you to go on this journey I was in

college and there was a group paper

assigned and you had like five people

and everyone had to do five pages and I

went to the professor and I said I will

write double the amount of pages if I

can work by

myself and he was like Vanessa the point

of the paper is not the paper it's

working with the people and I was like

and I started to cry in his office I was

like that student I was like I I don't

know how and he was like Vanessa you're

very good at science you're very good at

breaking things down what if you studied

for people like you study for

chemistry that was like an aam for me he

said why don't you study good

conversation why don't you study the

popular kids why don't you look at what

are they doing in conversation that's

working study it like it's a science

hence my brand was called science of

people that's when I realized okay it

didn't come naturally to me but maybe

there's research on actual things I can

do with my body things I can do I can

say verbally questions that work that

will help me learn this the other way

turning soft skills into hard skills

that's when I started creating my first

conversational blueprints that's when I

started creating my conversation formula

it and it started to work IED started to

try out these kind of tiny experiments

and I actually started to feel like

myself make more friends it was tools I

had to use tools to be able to connect

because it did not come naturally to me

was it fixed from day one no so it was a

journey it was a real journey yeah I

think that's important because often

people think you know read the book get

the tips and tricks and you're you're

changed and you're fixed you talk about

I think later in your life where you

enter a dinner party and your husband uh

was there with you and you went home and

told him that you thought everyone was

angry at you yeah when was that that was

probably maybe four or five years later

okay so I started mostly with

conversation that was sort of my my

first tool I needed was questions I

wanted to ask first impressions and how

to close conversation very practically I

also realized about five years later my

I married my college sweetheart so I've

been with my husband for a long time and

he said to me you always think

everyone's angry at you I was like isn't

everyone angry at me

and I realized there are certain people

who misinterpret neutral facial

expressions as negative I have this

problem so I will see a neutral

expression on someone and assume they

are angry or afraid or stressed or don't

like me and that was creating this

really bad Loop because when you think

someone doesn't like you you shut down

and become more unlikable there was a

study I discovered right around this

time um this is done by uh Dr Van Sloan

he wanted to know what makes popular

kids popular very clever study he

studied thousands of high school

students across a variety of high

schools looking for patterns why is it

that some kids across these grades and

ages are really popular he had all the

kids ranked across all these schools he

had them looked at traits and then he

guessed what made the popular kids

popular were they more athletic were

they more attractive were they funnier

were they smarter what was it can you

guess what it

was uh I'm so I'm just basing this on

the kids that were popular in my school

um they were funnier they were

self-deprecating to some degree they

were good at they were remotely good at

some sports maybe um they were funny

happy I don't know what so he found that

the most popular kids AC the one single

variable that was hold held true across

all the different students was the most

popular kids had the longest list of

people they liked so when he asked one

of the the questions of the survey was

who do you like they had the longest

lists and when he looked at their

day-to-day they had micro moments of

liking they would go down the hallway

and be like hey Chad hey Chelsea hey

Sarah they liked so many people and that

in turn made them more likable this

showed me that being likable isn't AR

control being likable means you have to

be first Liker if you set out to like

more people you become more

likable and that was a really big shift

for me because for so long I thought it

was all about me it's a very selfish way

to be right I was like I better be

impressive I better be funny but

actually what makes us likable is just

liking as many people as possible I was

laughing as you're speaking because I

was just playing out all the different

sort of personas of people listening

right now yeah and I just had this one

Persona of the person sat at home who

just like slumped over because they

realized they hate

everybody when you said that they were

like I hate everybody look I get it

I get it I get it and I also think that

if you hate everyone if that's you let

me try to convince you for a second it

could be because you're asking the wrong

questions okay I think I fell into that

camp I don't need people I don't like

people I was very much in that camp for

the first couple of years why because I

had terrible interactions and terrible

conversations and it was awkward of

course I didn't like people but I was

also asking the wrong questions and I

was telling the wrong stories I was

trying to be impressive the best way to

be impressive to be likable is to help

people impress you is to make them feel

so liked that they begin to like you

back it's aggressively liking so that

means that when you're with someone you

should be constantly giving them verbal

and non-verbal assurances of how much

you want to like them watch them change

watch your relationships transform so I

make it a policy of aggressively liking

people so I have um three phrase Magic

phrases for like ability can I teach

them to you please okay so I want you to

use these as many times as you can three

magic phrases for like ability one I was

just thinking of you okay so here's how

you use this authentically right you

think of a lot of people in your life

all the time yeah if you are thinking of

someone and you can text them text them

I was just thinking of you how are you I

was just thinking of you how'd that

project go I was just thinking of you it

has been a while since we talked or and

better you see a movie you see a

documentary you see a Macha latte you

see a mug you see a ceramic candle and

you're like oh this made me think of you

so my text messages my convers are full

of actual moments where I was triggered

to think of that person actually that

this thing made me think of you or I was

just thinking of you I wanted to ask you

about if you don't think of someone

they're not a person you need to have in

your life okay so that's number one

that's number I want to pause on number

one because I've got some sort of

questions to ask here yes it sounds

exhausting it sounds like it's going to

cost me a lot of time that I don't

necessarily have and this is just my

like my Surface level reaction was oh

God another

job you know what I mean I just I like

if I've got to set aside an hour to like

text everyone I know and go I'm just

thinking of you it's gonna be exhausting

I've got like six friends and I've got

my my partner I got my family and my

team it's a lot it's a lot then just

them and also it doesn't take an hour

when you're like oh stainless steel mug

this made me think of you right like

you're only doing it when it's actually

naturally occurring to you I don't want

you to sit at your desk and be like I'm

due for some I was just thinking of yous

no this happens in the wild okay you're

watching a documentary you're at a

restaurant you're on the bus you're like

oh that reminds me of this person quick

text that is less work than missing an

old friend and not knowing what to say

it is less work to see something in real

life or have a thought of like I wonder

how Sarah is and reaching out to them

then I Miss Sarah but I'm not going to

reach out to

her it's also less work when you see

someone and you haven't seen them in a

while or they're a friend of a friend or

they're that casual coworker

relationship and you're like what do I

say I think it's a lot of work to go up

to that person and be like how was your

weekend I think that's a lot of work I

think boring small talk is a lot of work

if you actually thought of them to say

you know I know you love Dolphins I saw

this dolphin documentary on Netflix have

you seen it I was just thinking of you

made me think of you I got another

concern so if I if I start firing out

these WhatsApp messages telling people

when I'm thinking of them it's just

going to be it's going to be opening up

loads of conversations that I then have

to deal with do you know what I mean

like it's going to be like hey I was

just thinking of you and then they reply

they go oh how how are you and I go I'm

good thanks and then they go I go how

are you they go I'm good thanks and then

do you know what I mean and then they

ask me I don't believe in asking how are

you that's a whole another thing this is

a good test if you are worried that

they're going to start a conversation

that's going to bore you and feel like

work they're not a close friend so don't

text them okay it's a very good test if

there's someone where you're like I

don't really want to hear how they are

yeah them okay this is for the people

who you want to level up with there are

three levels of intim

people who you kind of know you know

their personal you know their General

traits where they work where they live

what they do that's it you don't want to

go any different with them level two

people are people where they know your

personal concerns you know their goals

their motivations their personality

traits their worries those are people

who you want to invest in then there's a

last level which is the most deep level

which is called self-narrative which is

the story We Tell ourselves about

ourselves if you categorize your

relationships another activity I love

for my students to do is make those

three levels on a piece of paper write

down the 20 people you can think of the

top 20 people you spend the most time

with where they fall so we have

acquaintances we have acquaintances who

just kind of know where you're from what

do you do the B people yeah right and by

the way some of the people who you're

close with might you might not be deep

with yeah true right level two personal

concerns could they tell you what is

your Steven biggest goal right now okay

and then the middle layer I didn't

understand that's the middle layer that

that's the miday so it's General traits

personal concerns self-narrative what's

self-narrative so this is what my my

next book is about I'm doing research on

it right now self-narrative is story you

tell yourself about yourself so is this

a group of people it's the levels of

intimacy you are with someone so would

your partner okay

know the story you tell yourself about

yourself I'll give you an example 100%

she would I think so so I think that

there are basically three main types of

narratives and you should know what

these are for the closest people in your

life maybe only two or three and you

should also know what it is for yourself

the best one is a hero narrative this is

I've worked really hard I've had some

challenges and mistakes but I've

overcome with hard work and smarts and

now I am where I am every version of

their story their career their life

their relationships is that same

narrative over and over again then

there's what I think is called the

Healer narrative again I'm doing

research on this from an next book the

Healer narrative their story is all

about helping others they typically are

in careers of service of helping others

physical therapists nurses Healthcare

their story is how can I be more helpful

they tend to have a problem though if

you're in a relationship with a with a

Healer is they always put other people's

needs before them themselves they're do

they have some kind of historic trauma

they can and a lot of the times they

were put in a position of caretaking too

early like they were told that you're of

value if you can caretake you're of

value if you put your needs last so they

tend to be people Pleasers they tend to

say yes to everything you have to be

careful if you work with a Healer

because they're great to work with they

help help help but they say yes to too

much so uh healer is the middle one the

last one is victim narrative victim

narrative no matter what personal

professional love life taxes they have

the same narrative I experienced

challenges and mistakes and I didn't

overcome no matter how hard I work no

matter how smart I am the world is

against me so question I ask people to

begin to uncover their self- narrative

is do you feel lucky do you feel lucky I

feel very lucky I also feel very lucky

people who have a resounding yes to I

feel lucky are more likely heroes or or

healers people who say I don't feel

lucky I feel very unlucky are typically

victims Dr Richard wisman did a study he

asked people to perceive their own luck

how lucky do you feel then he gave them

a challenge he gave them a newspaper and

he said I want you to count the amount

of images in this

newspaper they sat with the newspaper

and they counted all the images but

there was a trick there's always a trick

in these studies on the second page of

the newspaper in big print it said stop

counting there are 42 Imes in this

newspaper almost all of the people who

perceived themselves as lucky saw the ad

closed the paper and gave it back so

there are 42 images almost none of the

Unlucky people did The Unlucky people

missed the ad and kept counting spent a

lot of time and made more mistakes this

means that if you think of yourself as

lucky you literally see more

opportunities if you think of yourself

as unlucky you miss them is it possible

to change how you see yourself I do

believe in a growth mindset so I do

believe that if you if this is

resonating with you and like you're like

uh oh I feel unlucky I might have this

victim self-narrative I do believe it's

possible to change your perception of

yourself and that's starting with small

moments of heroism I think that changing

your people skills saying I don't like

people and saying I'm going to find a

way to like people saying I'm bad at

conversation I'm going to find a way to

be good at conversation to say I'm an

awkward person no I'm a recovering

awkward person if we can begin to take

those tiny experiments and change them

one by one we begin to have small

moments of heroism and that's how we

change our self narrative as Employer I

think about this a lot these sort of

verbal and non-verbal cues I actually I

had an interview some time ago and I

think I came out of the interview and I

think objectively the person might have

been qualified but there was something

about their energy or cues or something

that signaled something else to me that

they were an unhappy person or they were

tired or they didn't really want to be

here or something like that are there

any studies that confirm that our hidden

communication is driving our success in

the working environment yes so this

study blew my mind it's 58,000 working

hours over 11 different companies so a

huge am amount of data they wanted to

know if low performers infect the people

around them and if High performers

infect people around them what they

found was if you sit within 25 F feet of

a high performer your own performance

improves by

15% here's the kicker if you sit within

25 ft of a low performer your own

performance decreases by

30% this means that our negative

emotions are more contagious that if

you're around people who are low

performers whatever that means to you

who have negative cues who are feeling

anxious or tired or low confident you

could catch those cues and that affects

your own performance

this is why it is incredibly critical to

invest in the five people who you spend

the most time with you want to make sure

those five people are the cues you want

to catch do you like the cues they're

sending do they give you the right

motivation feelings do they make you

feel like do they make you a better

version of

yourself there's there's just one more

chemical aspect of this which we have to

do more research

on this is a very gross study but it's

one of my favorites it's a little gross

you ready okay so they brought people

into their lab they so them up into two

different groups and they made the first

group wear a sweat suit where they catch

your sweat and run on the treadmill so

they sweat a lot on the treadmill the

second group they wore sweatsuits and

they took them skydiving for the first

time both groups sweat a lot treadmill

sweat and skydiving sweat they took

these sweat samples and they had

unsuspecting participants go into fmri

machines and scan their brains then they

gave them both sweat samples to smell

poor these poor people did not didn't

know what they were smelling they went

it

everyone who smelled the skydiving sweat

had an activation in their own amydala

their own fear response triggered

another words when they smelled fear

sweat they didn't know why they began to

feel afraid everyone who smelled the

treadmill sweat had no change at all

this means that yes we can talk about

facial expressions and body language and

vocal cues and words but there's also

something chemically happening with the

people around us that we can literally

smell fear and we catch it and that is

also why it's really important to follow

our gut oh dear I was going to say well

then we're all screwed aren't we we

can't we can't do anything because

there's if we're giving off these

chemicals which are impacting those

around us it doesn't matter if I smile

and do the whole like no because I think

intention is the back door into

confidence it's very hard to fake

confidence I don't believe in fake it

till you make it I don't really but if I

say I have a conversational tool for you

that's going to make your conversations

better you become less nervous you

become more excited you ask a better

question they give you a really good

answer you feel super charismatic they

feel really liked you feel real likable

oh we have a good little cycle so I

think that intention going in with

really purposeful cues helps you feel

more confident and triggers these

beautiful Cycles the cycle is this the

cycle you're talking about the Q cycle

the Q cycle yes I'll put it on the

screen and in the description for anyone

that wants to see it but when I saw this

the reason I printed this off is because

it really hit close to home because I'm

someone that meets a lot of people and

um when I meet people people there on

the very rare occasion something about

someone will just kind of throw my

energy and it throws my energy to the

point that I realize I'm then acting a

little bit in terms of my interaction

with them and it's almost like I can't

control it like something about the

person has unnerved me or just made and

it's nothing that I could consciously

tell you like say it was the way they

shook my hand just something about them

yeah throws me into this different state

yeah um and when I saw this I I I almost

figured out why because the first step

in this Q you you explain it I mean it's

your Q cycle yes okay so we often

mistakenly think that we send a signal

to someone else they send a signal back

to us and that's it we don't realize as

there's a cycle happening within us

which is that if you send me a negative

q i internalize it and that changes the

cues I'm sending back to you here's a

very simple experiment that showed this

they put a participant in a room and

they had an actor in the room flashed

them a fe a social rejection cue that

could be

an eye roll a scoff a distancing and

blocking Behavior so the participants in

the room and this person across from

them they don't know as an actor sends

them a social rejection cue what they

found was the moment that participant

saw the social rejection queue their own

pupils dilated and their field of vision

increased this means that somebody saw

uhoh that person doesn't like me and

their body reacted to fight ORF flight

do does anyone else feel this way about

me

are there any Escape Routes for me and

that then changed what cues they sent

back to that person they were more

anxious they were more nervous if you

walk into a room with someone and you're

feeling bad you probably caught a queue

here's the good news you can stop the Q

cycle from being negative there's also

positive cues right we can catch

positive cues that can be good for us

but we can stop the negative cycle if we

label the queue we see Dr Matthew

liberman at UCLA studied this very

clearly he put people in fmri machines

and he flashed them a fear micro

expression the one that you showed us

earlier with your eyes really wide when

people saw the fear micro expression

they caught the fear they began to feel

afraid and their amdal it up but when he

taught them say fear or think fear he

taught them the micro expression it

stopped activating their amydala meaning

if you know how to read the 97 cues and

you see contempt or social rejection or

a mouth shrug or a lip purse all not

great cues you can in your head say lip

purse I'm good or clocked noted that

Intel is actually empowering so that

back door into confidence is also you

can label it name it tame it and you're

in control of it that is a much better

way to interact and also can help you

like people for all my people who don't

like people okay so in those moments I

should in my head just say what lab

clocked yeah that's what I say to myself

or like red flag or noted you're in

you're particularly famous for a TED

Talk that you did yeah which did very

very well um it was called you are

contagious and it really opened my eyes

to the importance of hand gestures yes

which I didn't really think were that

important before but it's funny because

going through this election cycle

obviously Trump has now been elected as

the next president of the United States

He is someone in particular that uses a

lot of hand gestures and in your Ted

Talk you make the case that hand

gestures matter oh so much I think the

hands of the windows into the soul I

think what we underestimate is the power

of our gestures love it just love it

just those jazz just jazz hands so

here's I want to do a little experiment

with you so I'm going to put my hands in

my lap I've been very careful to leave

my hands on the table for the entire

interview that's on purpose now

something funny happens in your brain

when you can't see my hands and the

longer my hands are underneath the table

the more your amydala will begin to Fire

and the more distracted you become with

where are her hands why are her hands

under the table and the moment I bring

my hands back out again your brain

goes and that is because hands show

intention and this makes sense from an

evolutionary perspective so if we go

back to caveman days if we were

approached by a stranger caveman and

they went friend friend friend friend

friend friend we saw they weren't

carrying a rock or a spear and they were

probably a friend in fact when we go so

nice to meet you we can see someone's

hand we know that they're literally not

going to harm us so our brain still

keeps this mechanism that if we're on

video and we can't see someone's hands

or they walk into an office with their

hands in their pockets or behind their

back we feel a little bit uneasy so

there's two things for this first is the

moment someone first sees you you want

to be friend friend friend good to see

see you oh so nice to meet you what put

your hand up for people that can't see

the moment I walk into a room hey nice

to see you even before I handshake even

an old friend I'll be like oh my gosh so

good to see you on Zoom morning for

people for people that can't see she's

basically putting her hand in the air

which like a little wave W Little Wave

we love a palm as humans we love seeing

someone's Palm there's something about

it that makes us feel like ah they are

literally open palmed so that's the

first in the first few seconds of

someone seeing you in person on video

try to flash your palm very very simply

second we understand competence in two

ways very highly competent people know

their content so well they can speak to

you on two tracks they can speak to you

verbally but they also can speak to you

with their hands this is why we loved

picture books as kids and so when

someone is speaking we're listening to

their words but second we're looking are

their hands outlining their words so for

example all the best TED Talks start the

same way and this is what got me my TED

Talk is we studied all the TED talks

from 2010 looking for patterns and my

team and I coded every Ted Talk we can

find looking for differences between the

most viral TED talks and the least viral

viral TED Talks we found the most viral

Ted speakers used an average an average

of 465 hand gestures in 18 minutes

whereas the least popular Ted talkers

use an average of 271 gestures so not

quite half meaning if someone walks on

stage here's a a really good Ted Talk

they all start this way you

ready today I want to talk to you about

a big idea we're going to share three

different things that are going to

change your life so for people listening

I was outlining with my hands along with

my words if I were to get on stage and

say today I have a really big idea it's

huge and hold up my hands in a really

small way your brain is 12.5 times more

likely to believe my gesture over my

words and so what we can do as speakers

as very highly charismatic speakers is

think about how can I outline very

basically not modern dance what I'm

saying or how can I emphasize things

with my gestures if something is Big

Show me is it beach ball big is it what

is this big donkey big is this a donkey

I don't even know yeah big a goat a goat

this is a goat Pig if you have something

that's really small and no big deal

doing this actually helps you think that

it's not a big deal I'm making a little

kind of dismissive gesture with my hand

this also works with emphasizing points

you want people to remember if you have

three ideas tell someone you have three

ideas it is very hard to lie with our

gestures for example you want to do

experiment with me sure okay I want you

to say five but hold up the number

three five hard right yeah so it's

really hard I have to think about them

separately yeah it's really hard our

brain is not meant to lie with gesture

which is why humans pay so close

attention to gestures because we're

looking to see are they congruent it is

so hard to be in congruent with gestures

Liars typically use less gestures so

we're also drawn to people who are using

gestures who are congruent with their

gestures because it makes us feel like

oh they know their stuff and they're

being honest so it made me reflect it

how do we establish causation here in

terms of these hand gestures could it be

the case that the more confident Ted

speakers are doing more gestures because

they're less

nervous so is it about nerves um and the

less um confident more nervous Ted

speakers are doing less gestes just

because they self soothing a lot and

they're they're kind of closing off

their body is confidence the thing here

is it nerves I don't think so I think

it's about engagement so I think most

Ted speakers I watch these TED Talks

they're all good all of them are good

and some of them are experts in their

field the difference is do I want to

watch their good it is hard for me as a

viewer to pay attention for 18 minutes

with someone who didn't use enough

gestures it was like physically hard for

my brain to pay attention I think those

speakers what good or not had over

rehearsed and rehearsed out their hand

gestures or were holding a Podium or

we're holding a clicker too hard so I

actually think that it's less to do with

the speaker's nerves or confidence and

it's more to do with are they going to

let themselves use their hands to

explain their points and that becomes

more engaging one of the things I've

noticed on this podcast is people who

are using their hands are more

expressive and if they're more

expressive there's likely to be more

sort of intonations in their voice and

if there's more intonations it's more

engaging and if it's more engaging then

it's more retentive for the algorithm if

it's more retentive the algorithm it's

suggested more if it's suggested more

there's more

views so I would like to tell my guests

all the past particularly future guests

that if you're if you have more

expression in what you're saying and

more intonations in your voice then our

show will grow okay let's talk about two

things here one is we did a test on my

YouTube channel and found that if we

used a thumbnail of me doing any hand

gesture it didn't even matter what it

was it could be this it could be this

any hand gesture that got more clicks

people even in the thumbnail like to see

the hand gesture even more than my crazy

facial expressions we tried both so yes

we are because if you see a thumbnail of

me you know holding up two you're like

what two things is she talking about

what is it so it's we we like it it

shows competence and the second thing is

that vocal variety is an incredibly

important aspect of Charisma we're

talking about gestures but there is a

feedback loop here that the more like if

you if I were try if I were G going to

sit on my hands for this interview you

would notice my facial expression would

get less charismatic my vocal tone would

be less charismatic it's really hard to

be charismatic without movement vocal

variety is a critical aspect of both

warmth and competence that is because

when we hear someone who's able to for

example give us the Ted Talk voice so

I'm going give you the Ted Talk voice

you

ready this point is going to change the

way that we think about the world and if

we don't analyze this point we will be

in huge trouble like that is a voice

that is telling you o this is important

you also hear that really good speakers

will use like a numbers voice so a

numbers voice sounds like this did you

know that 43% of humans all believe in

the same thing

43% like there's and if you're telling a

story it changes again so a story tone

would go like this you're never going to

believe what happened to me so last week

I'm walking down the street and I saw

this guy it's a totally different vocal

variety that is a gift to your listener

that makes you more engaging because

they're able to clock H we're doing a

number now oh we have a story now oh

this is an important point I better

write it down really good Ted speakers

are outlining their talk for you in me

in many different ways and that's the

best speakers I see on stage it's so

interesting because in this podcast we

um had quite a long conversation a

couple of months ago about arms on the

chair the chair that you're in now and

it was just this observation we had when

we first flew out here to New York the

chairs that we ordered were pretty

similar to this but they just happen to

have arms on them and what I noticed was

that guests would lean oh and and it

would take out their arms yes so it took

out their arms and they became less

expressive and the conversations were

less interesting yes so we removed the

arms again okay so let's talk about this

just very briefly yeah I actually do

recommend chairs with arms not in this

setup because look at the difference so

actually right before this interview you

asked me to scoot my chair in right your

amazing team ask me to good my turn

thank you for that because it makes it

so that I want to put my hands up if I

were to be sitting farther back I'm just

going to lean back for a second I would

be tempted to put my hands in my lap yes

so the critical piece of this is you're

having me scoot up to the table it would

be really hard if I had arms because

then I would want to go like this and it

would make me look like a duck yes right

so you want to use a chair with arms to

be broader it actually does broaden your

arms out unless you're really close to

the table then you can put your hands on

the table but I I it's amazing how the

physical environment can change how we

are perceived and how we move but even

that we're very intentional about the

sort of mirroring our body language and

just making sure that we're head on

because this conversation is entirely

different if we're side on very much

it's not going to be the same very much

and there's not going to be the same

level of intimacy we also thought a lot

about the how big the table was this is

quite a big table what's the distance uh

I'm going to say it's about Just sh two

Mets wait can you hold your arm out okay

so this perfect distence the perfect

distance between two people having a

good conversation is that we could shake

hands if we wanted to okay and that is

because there are four different

proxemic zones so the fancy word for

space is proxemics I don't know if you

have the beautiful graphic I print out

this oh yes that's it yes so there are

four different space zones and these are

really good to know if you're trying to

set yourself up for Success the public

zone is about 5 to eight feet away I

don't know uh not feet but 5 to8 feet

away then you have the social Zone which

is where we like to socialize with

people that is depending on who you ask

three to 5 feet away then there's the

personal Zone that's our favorite Zone

that is about uh arms distance apart

right so we could shake hands if we

wanted to that's where our best

conversations happen and then there's

the in inate Zone a big mistake people

make is they Place their video camera

too close to their face which means they

are accidentally signaling intimacy cues

with their colleagues and their

co-workers have you ever been on a zoom

with someone where their FA is the

entire camera yeah I was on one earlier

on and you're like please back up and

that is because your brain is going too

close even though they're across a

camera so what I would really recommend

measure the distance between your nose

and your camera it should be one arm

length so it should be the tip of your

nose to the tip of your fingers or a

foot and a half to three feet away that

is the ideal zone for having good

conversation over Zoom that's really

interesting as well because I was

thinking about the conversation I had

actually on the way here in the car with

a colleague of mine and they had called

me on FaceTime now the thing with

FaceTime is it's going to be close it's

going to be close and it it did feel a

little bit intimate it does um because

they call me on FaceTime yes and

obviously if I was on my laptop they

would call me on Zoom or something else

and you there would be a so I think that

that's why we can sometimes at least

introverts feel like don't FaceTime me

it's way too personal it's because

there's a setup there that it's actually

accidentally tricking you into being in

the intimate Zone with someone this is

also why uh loud bars and nightclubs

work so well for facilitating romantic

relationships what happens in a loud bar

or a loud nightclub is you can't hear

someone so you go what and then you get

a little bit closer and all of a sudden

you're accidentally standing in

someone's intimate Zone which then that

Q cycle begins to kick in where you're

like well if I'm standing within a foot

and a half from this person maybe I

should feel intimate with them which

then makes you lean more makes you want

to touch more that is why people go to

bars and nightclubs to facilitate these

romantic relationships it's accidentally

going into the intimate Zone when I was

younger I've said this a few times on

the podcast before but it's feels very

relevant my brother my older brother

Jason he ordered this book called The

Game uh by Neil Strauss yes and it um he

ordered it to University but he

accidentally put the wrong address and

so it came to home this sounds like an

elaborate story for me like buying a

pickup artist book but it came to home

and I read the book and it was my first

time understanding that body language

was a important but even some you could

learn and and you know when I say body

language I mean everything um and it's

it's interesting because now after

reading your work I actually think maybe

what I should have been aiming at was

how to be more

charismatic and you talk about these

five science-based habits for being more

charismatic yeah I guess the first

question is what is charisma yes and

then what are these five science-based

habits that can make me more charismatic

as a person like how do I know if I'm

charismatic you are charismatic but you

lean higher on competence so so let's

break it down okay so this is not my

work this is the work of Dr Susan Fisk

this is a instrumental study it's been

repeated many times back in 2002 that

found that to be charismatic you have to

be both highly warm and highly competent

or more importantly if to Signal High

warmth and high competence and that this

is makes up 82% of impressions of people

warmth trust likeability friendliness

competence power reliability capability

so very highly charismatic people you

meet them you see them and they are

signaling you can trust me you like me

and boy am I reliable and competent at

the very same time so when I say you are

charismatic but you lean very high in

competence which means that people can

see you as cold or stoic if you're not

showing enough warmth cues have you been

told that intimidating

indirectly people are do scared to say

it me I'm joking but no I do get that I

do I do I think I have like some degree

of self as to how I come across and I

think how you described it is exactly

how I come across and that's not a bad

thing right like you get to pick your

own recipe like I lean a little higher

on the warm side I'm also female there

are differences between men and women so

typically not always men default to

higher incompetence women are defaulted

to hire in warmth typically not always

this isn't a bad thing but you should

know that if you are trying to come

across as warmer on your team you're

trying to inspire more collaboration

you're trying to make more friends you

want to dial up your warmth cues

if you're someone who's interrupted a

lot not taken seriously people forget

meeting you you need to dial up

confidence this is like a thermostat you

can dial up warmth cues and dial up

competence cues and this changes the way

people treat you so I have five power

cues for competence and I have five warm

cues for warmth we're going to go

through all of those I saw this

wonderful graph which kind of explains

it which I'll put on the screen for

anyone that's watching um and this was

really really interesting there's a

danger zone the danger zone I'm guess is

when you're low warmth and low

competence that's it that those are

those folks that are stoic if you don't

send enough warmth cues if you don't

send enough competence cues people

cannot trust you they have trouble

working with you they have trouble

talking to you this is the curse of very

smart people very smart people think my

ideas will stand alone my book smarts

are great I don't need to communicate

these cues my ideas are enough that's

what happened to Jamie Simmon off in the

tank he did not show enough warmth or

comp cues he relied solely on his ideas

and his numbers and he could not get a

deal so people who want to be taken

seriously you have to show warmth and

competence the other problem with highly

competent folks and you lean higher in

competence so this is for you too which

is it's directly from the

research too much competence without

enough warmth leaves people feeling

suspicious so no matter how competent

you are no matter how good your ideas

are if you are not showcasing that with

warmth people are skeptical of you and

this is what happens with a lot of my

students is they're like people don't

trust me they don't believe my ideas

they're skeptical I get push back or

they I do sales trainings they can't

close you'll push back on their numbers

and that is because some part of them is

saying I hear your competence but you're

not giving me enough warmth can you be

too warm you can be absolutely too warm

you can be too warm and too competent

too warm you know what that looks

like yes that's too

warm okay okay too warm is so we'll talk

about the five warmth cues too much of

any Q is dangerous right so too much

nodding too much laughing too much uh

vocalizations those are all too warm and

they make us think this person is a

bimbo or a dits or not competent that's

what happens we have too much warmth it

takes away from our competence where

should we start let's start with the

power Keys okay the power keys so this

is competence yes power keys let me get

some my power cues M okay so we talked

about the importance of hand gestures

there is a very good competent hand

gesture which everyone should know if

you want to be perceived as higher in

competence it's called the steeple oh

this the oh yes it's on the cover of my

book if you want to see it yes this

looks when your hands look like a little

steeple they're kind of relaxed open

it's a triangle for anyone that com kind

of like a triangle y a triangle it's a

power pose for the hands why if you are

doing this pose you're showing I'm not

hiding anything from you you can still

see my Palms but I am

very relaxed and poised enough so that

I'm keeping my hands together now be

careful don't drum this is evil fingers

yeah this is Mr Burns those of you who

know right so it's a nice still steeple

uh they have found they raided hand

gestures in a study and they found that

this was the single most the highest

rated hand gesture that leaders made was

when they made this gesture now

personally I don't use this a lot in my

interpersonal interactions because it

doesn't feel Supernatural to me it's

funny because we took one picture for my

cover tit cover photos and my all every

single picture of me from my cover

photos I was smiling and my wonderful

photographer Maggie Kirkland said

Vanessa can we just do one of you

serious and I was like but I'm not

serious she's like just just one just do

your most powerful power que and this is

the only picture and that was the one

that we chose for it so it's just funny

because it's a very high competence cue

so you can try the steeple just be

careful not to do evil finger evil

fingers with it that's a high confidence

CU that picture of you on the front what

is that signaling so it's a it's a

perfect balance right so one I have the

steeple Q competence gesture two I'm

angled towards you my body is angled

towards you which is a warmth you that's

fronting my toes are angled towards you

which is warmth I also have a smoldering

eye contact look which is high

competence which we can talk about and I

have an up face right I'm not in my

resting bothered face so that's a slight

warmth queue that is actually how it

makes me feel there's a there's an

element of power but it's not an

intimidating level of power because I

balanced it with that warmth yeah it's

like a

welcoming woo we did it now I got to do

it with the next one Ste okay SE SE yeah

second this is a weird one the most

important measurement on your entire

body is the distance between your

earlobe and your shoulder this distance

right here watch if I were to do this in

the interview the entire time if I were

to have a very small distance between my

Earl and my shoulder I would look

anxious I would also have a really hard

time giving you vocal power you would

have a hard do you trust me no you look

nervous right I look nervous there's a

direct correlation between confidence

and anxiety and the distance between our

shoulder and our Earl and very quickly

we're trying to just assess someone the

first few seconds of seeing them we're

trying to assess how confident are you

can I catch it we don't like people who

are anxious we don't want to talk to

someone like this because we don't want

to catch that anxiety but we do want to

talk to someone who has the max distance

between their earlobes and their

shoulder so when you're in a first

impression also in your profile

pictures I want a relaxed distance

shoulders down Earls out which is

another reason why I like that this is

how your table is set up because it

pushes my shoulders down so I have a max

distance that makes me look more

confident but it also makes me feel more

confident there's a look here so when

you do the steeple and then you roll

your shoulders down and back you will

begin to feel more

confident don't you feel good don't what

if you like raise your head though like

because if I'm trying to get my ears

away from my shoulders I might go like

this actually they're the same distance

so you want to actually keep your yeah

you want to keep your chin level and you

if you can help it you don't want to

actually look down at someone down your

nose at someone it's quite a um scornful

judgmental exactly so you just noticed

it even when I did it so it's not this

it's just this so maximizing this

difference third one I love eye contact

we all know good eye contact is

important but here's what you might not

know about good eye contacts eye contact

is a power move when you look at someone

at the end of your

sentence so we're very used to if

someone's thinking about something and

they're processing something in their

head and I'm telling you that there are

465 gestures in a TED Talk that is the

most important way that I want to

showcase something to you that we like

it when someone is actually accessing

different memories or areas of their

brain but then when I end my sentence

looking right at you you're

like so highly competent people make eye

contact specifically at the end of their

sentences to drill a point and ideally

when the other person is saying

something

important okay interesting I just did it

then but I do that when I'm when I'm

doing interviews because I kind of like

look off into the distance to think a

little bit and then I come back to ask

the worst advice I hear people give body

language experts give make more eye

contact make 100% eye contact

actually in Western culture as they've

studied this the ideal amount of eye

contact is between 60 and 70% of the

conversation if you make over 70% eye

contact it's actually considered a

territorial gesture so if I were be

making 100% eye contact with you it feel

very invasive very awkward we like it

when someone is processing or gathering

information from around like if I'm

processing something or I'm thinking

about something or I'm accessing all

that matters is at the end of my point

I'm looking right at you and that feels

so much more powerful Okay so that's

number three yeah that's number three

yeah okay fourth one one of my favorites

it's called a lower lid Flex lower lid

Flex is one of the least utilized but

one of my favorite cues so biologically

speaking when we are trying to see

something far away we Harden our lower

Lids like I'm trying to read the titles

on your bookshelf I Harden my lower Lids

that is because when our eye is trying

to see far it Squints to block out the

light so you'll see more details in my

face when you harden your lower lid at

me so Harden your lower lid if you look

at People's sexiest men alive almost

every man in that magazine

is it's Zoolander right blue steel blue

steel is actually just a lower lid Flex

that is because when someone is trying

to really focus on something and really

understand something their lower lid is

flexed as as you're doing right now and

boy oh boy do we like it when someone is

lower lid flexing at us because it means

you are really trying to understand and

see me so a lower lid Flex is a great

power Q to use in moderation right

nothing too much that when someone is

saying something on a date or in a

meeting or a colleague is saying

something really important and you want

to show them I am really listening that

lower lid Flex shows them I am super

focused and intense on you that is why

women find men who do the lower lid Flex

very sexy because they feel like he's

really focusing on me now there's a

little side note the lower lid Flex

lower lid Flex is not it's inherently in

a POS postive Q it's a CU of Focus right

if you are in a presentation or a

meeting and you say something and

someone suddenly Li flexes at

you you might have just said something

in there like really yeah so for me this

was a game-changing moment as I was

giving a presentation to a bunch of

Executives and I said something about

oxytocin which is the the hormone of um

love and cuddle and connection and he

goes I saw him lower lid Flex at me but

he's also turned his head though I don't

know if he I don't remember if he turned

his head but all I noticed is that

distinctly he went from mhm mhm to ah

yes and I went does that make sense any

questions so if you see a lower lid flex

your best choice is to try to gather

more information that make sense all

good any questions for me how we feel

about this so I said any questions for

me and he goes and I looked right at him

I said any questions for me he said you

know I think they gave my wife oxytocin

and labor is that the same thing and

it's true that they give a form of

oxytocin to induce women in labor That's

How Strong oxytocin is it in high doses

it will put women into labor it's a form

it's called pcin I said you're

absolutely right in medical settings

they can give synthetic forms of

oxytocin to push women into labor that

was a moment for me because one is I

realized I was able to stop the

skepticism and the confusion right there

before we moved on to anyone else

anything else and now when I teach

oxytocin I say in Social settings

oxytocin means this because in medical

settings that means something different

so noticing that lower lid Flex is

incredibly important for you to

understand where you might have a hint

of skepticism or a hint of confusion if

you're in a sales meeting or a

presentation you want to make sure you

have addressed whatever that person is

flexing about before you move on super

interesting in that example you give

there as well had you not investigated

that lower lid Flex you might have also

thought something you said was wrong and

lost your confidence and that can spiral

into you know closing off and becoming a

worse presenter this is why I thought

people hated me and I hated people so

for my folks that are listening who are

like I hate people and I get it I was

misreading cu's as skeptical or negative

of me when it could have been neutral or

curiosity or trying to understand

something better if you can give these a

try it will help you more deeply

understand people which might help you

like them

more ready for the fifth one I'm ready

for the fifth okay the fifth one this is

a vocal cue so we talked a lot about

body language cues but vocal cues are

incredibly

important vocal

cues tell someone how you are feeling

about them and how you feel about

yourself one of the biggest ones is an

accidental question inflection a

question inflection is when we go up at

the end of our sentence so it sounds

like we're asking a question even if

we're actually using a

statement the brain research has

actually looked at what the brain does

when it here is an accidental question

reflection if we are listening to

someone and we hear them accidentally

use the question reflection our brain

goes from listening to scrutinizing why

our brain wonders why did you ask me

that Liars typically accidentally use

the question in flection if I say to my

daughter did you take the cookie from

the cookie jar and she goes

no I Liars are asking do you believe

this so we have noticed we did a massive

experiment in our lab where we had

people play two truths and a lie with us

so share two truths about themselves and

a lie and we found overwhelmingly one of

the biggest patterns there's a couple of

different patterns one of the biggest

ones was that Liars asked their lie

statement so like it would sound like

this here you can play with me and I'll

I'll add the question reflection to one

I love dogs I live in Austin Texas and I

love

cilantro oh yeah you don't like cilant

no it's like a crime against humanity

like why do people cantro on anything so

notice people ask the lie because they

were asking do you believe this so our

brain is very Adept at this if we hear

The Accidental question reflection used

we go wait a minute is someone lying to

me the biggest mistake that salespeople

make is they get through their entire

pitch and they ask their number so

sounds like

this hi we'd love to do business with

you we'd love to have your project and

the cost of this service is

$5,000 if you ask your number you are

begging people to negotiate with you if

you are asking for a raise or you are

asking for a certain salary and you ask

it you are signaling to the other person

I don't really believe this number and

you shouldn't either so the power CU

number five power CU is using the

downward inflection highly competent

people they do not mistakenly use the

question reflection they actually go

down at the end of their sentences

President Obama was very good at is very

good at slinging down his words which

makes you want to listen so it sounds

like this I'm going to say nothing so

you can hear it the problem in this

country is that we don't take seriously

enough the issues of our people and if

we don't take those issues seriously we

will be in grave trouble so he tends to

go down at the end of his sentences he

also has a lot of space in the bottom of

his mouth that makes us gives us him

more resonance but it also makes us

think oh he really believes his word

because it's the opposite of the

question reflection if you have a

boundary if you're setting a limit if

you're telling something someone

something really important about you say

it don't ask ask it that is the biggest

thing you can do to get people to take

you seriously interesting and don't ask

your name most often I hear people ask

their own name and it destroys their

vocal Charisma so that would be my name

is Vanessa van

Edwards that my name is Vanessa van

Edwards your perceptions of my

confidence in those two introductions

are radically different there's a study

that looked at this and they looked at

the vocal statements of Surgeons they

had surgeons come into their lab and

record 10-second voice tone Clips the

clips that are most important when

they're meeting patients their name

their specialty and where they worked

sounded like this hi my name is Dr

Edwards I specialize in oncology and I

work at Children's Presbyterian hospital

they took these clips and they warbled

the words so you could hear the volume

the pace the Cadence but not the actual

words being said so sounded like

this I worked very hard on practicing

that by the way that's amazing because

it has testes sound like me but nothing

they took these clips and they had

people rate these surgeons on warmth and

competence the two things that we know

are most important for Charisma the

doctors who had the lowest ratings of

warmth and competence had the highest

rate of malpractice

lawsuits in other words we don't Sue

doctors based on their skills we Sue

doctors based on our perception of their

skills and that happens within the first

few seconds of hearing them so if you

give the question reflection on your

name on your specialty on what you do

people begin to doubt you so the bad

doctors sounded like this hi my name is

Dr Edwards I specialize in oncology and

I work at Children's petarian

Hospital those doctors got raided as low

in both warmth and competence because

their brains were going why are they

asking are they not sure I'm not sure

either so it's really signaling

conviction in who you are yeah what

you're about and what you do

interesting so practice your name your

price my name is Steven no that was up

that was a little hi my name is Steven

that's it okay yeah okay I literally

asked that like a question didn't I the

first one I was like hello my name is

Stephen I was I was actually asking I

was trying to ask you if it was a good

pronunciation that's so funny that was

the upward inflection and didn't it feel

different totally different the second

one was me uh so the first one was like

seeking validation and you use a lot of

downward inflection except when you're

asking questions which we like okay

right that's why you lean higher in comp

competence is you use already a lot of

downward inflection it's so interesting

because as you were speaking something

came to mind which I was reading about

in your work um which is you're really

good at what you do you're like very

good as a guest on a podcast and just as

a professional generally and as I was

thinking this I was saying to myself I'm

sure she knows and I'm sure she can tell

from my face that I think she's good but

it's funny because in your work you say

that we're actually we over assume

people can read us yes so like when I

was thinking oh she's so good and in

your work it says like it says that I'm

I was doing it I was assuming you knew

how I felt about you but in your work

you also make the case that I've

actually I should say it yes yes we

there's an effect where we think that

people know how we feel specifically

it's called signal amplification bias

there's a name for this study which is

that we think our signals are obvious

that if we like someone or if we're

having a good time we think oh they for

sure know it they don't oh the three

magic phrases we never finish them

that's why you say I was just thinking

of you

that's a way of assuring someone I do

think of you only if it's true the

second one is you're always

so so if you're with someone and you're

impressed by them or they're interesting

or they're funny saying you always make

me laugh you're always so interesting

you're always so great to interview

you're always so great at interviews

giving them a label that is a positive

label is the best gift you can give

someone because it's fighting that

signal amplification bias and the last

one is last time we talked you mentioned

yeah we are so honored when we get brain

space that you remembered and you're

going to bring it up and you

specifically bring up something that

they lit up with so they were like ah it

was great it was exciting it was

wonderful those are my three magic

phrases and it's because they are

fighting that signal implication bias I

have no idea if you like this interview

I have no idea if you like my work I

have no idea and the more that you can

broadcast those symbols those signals

that more people actually like you m so

what do you what advice would you give

me then as an interview I guess I'm an

interview host of the show what is cuz

people come here sometimes they're

nervous you know we have people come and

they they um some people come in their

nervous a little bit and I always try I

always want to make them feel

comfortable but I you know as you said I

probably don't rank that high on warmth

so it doesn't come that natural to me

I'm not the kind of person that comes

out and it's like hi welcome and like

hey and that would be off brand you yeah

and it wouldn't be authentic no no would

it would be off brand for you right it's

too much okay so five warmth cues so for

those of you who are listening the five

power cues I just shared those are if

you think you are really high in warmth

but you worry that people don't take you

seriously you're worried that people

ignore you you get interrupted in

meetings I want you to use those five

power cues if that's you now I'm going

to teach you five warmth cues if you

have ever been told you're intimidating

hard to talk to cold if you often feel

like people are holding back or not

opening up to you I want you to use

these five warmth cues this ISS dialing

up your thermostat okay these are for

you you too mhm first we love a triple

nod research has found that if we do a

slow triple nod the other person speaks

67%

longer so as an interview this is a

great cue watch so here's my my triple

not

is we love it it's like a non-verbal dot

dot dot it's like tell me more tell me

more now be careful don't bobblehead so

you don't want to do it too much right

that's too high and warm and second you

don't want to do it too fast too fast of

a triple nod is impatience it means shut

up yeah so if you want someone to wrap

if you want someone to wrap a question

yeah that that yeah that's that's

exactly right so here's for everyone

watching here's

good here's please hurry

up yeah that shut the up I've seen

that before and it works it's a really

nice way of saying Please rap please end

so I love a warm triple nod you have to

be careful with it okay so that's cue

number one second a head tilt so

universally if we're trying to hear

something we tilt our head up and we

expose our ear right we're we're as if

we're like What was that like dogs do

this when they're like you know they

expose their ear humans also do this

across cultures because it's a it's kind

of a way that we're like oh I I'm

listening to this research has found

that if you deliver bad news with a head

tilt you are more likable so people take

the news better if you deliver bad news

with a SL head tilt because it literally

makes you look more warm it literally

makes you look like like you're

listening no I only want you to do this

when you're actually listening but a

head tilt is also a way that you can

slightly add warmth to your conversation

or to your interview or to your date not

too okay so we're going to go back to so

we don't want to go too far that looks

weird a little weird right not too much

and um I also like to teach a head tilt

to my highly warm folks who are Bobble

headers so if anyone if you're like oh I

do this a lot yeah I I'm a bobble header

I'm a recovering Bobble header because I

like to people like me right so I'll

I'll nod too much if you are a bobble

header you can train yourself to replace

it with the head tilt because it's

physically impossible to head tilt while

you nod so if you're a bobble header

just head tilt okay head tilt there's

something about the head tilt which

makes me it signals they care yeah and

they they're empathetic yeah there's

some I don't know what it is about

someone's head head tilt that cuz if

someone was firing me and they were

doing it like this I feel like they

don't care there's something Bress but

if they do it like this it's like you

really care about me that's so crazy

just such a small that one little thing

you know that you mentioned the book The

Game yes I know a lot about that world

and there's a there's a funny trick they

teach which I'll teach you it's not part

of my warmth cues but I'm going to teach

it to you because I think it's

interesting don't let don't let anyone

use this on you okay and nobody at home

used this on anyone else don't use this

on anyone else but so there's this thing

that NLP people will do or uh pickup

artists will do where they move their

hand like this and it Begins the other

person will begin to nod because our

typically when we do this with our hand

the other person starts to nod which

makes you think I agree I agree I agree

what are you doing for anyone that it's

I'm moving my hand up and down in a

nodding yes motion and so what what I've

noticed very manipulative people will do

is they'll be doing this as they speak

like don't you understand what I'm

saying do you get this and the other

person will start to nod and I've seen

audiences entire audience will start

nodding and then you think to yourself

well I'm nodding so I must agree with

this person it's a secret way to get

someone to secretly agree with you so

just be careful make sure no one uses

that on

you and you're doing it in a bit of a

circular motion it looks like it's not

straight up and down you're just kind of

like anyone that can't see she's like

we're rolling something forward and then

you're like I want to it's really hard

to not Nodge your head when someone's

doing this which then makes you feel

like you agree with them that's so crazy

it's like you you've got like a string

on my head a string on your it's very

weird so don't let anyone do that to you

and don't use it don't use it on anyone

I don't teach it in my books because

it's like I'm worried that you it's too

powerful it's too powerful okay triple

nod head tilt one and two okay third we

already talked about this one a

authentic smile right a smile that

reaches all the way up into your eyes

highly warm people typically do do that

authentic smile more now I don't like a

fake smile so I only want you to do it

when you're

authentic about that was my authentic

you laughed this is why I don't smile

this is why people think I'm

intimidating because people laugh at my

spet that's good that was better that

was better I can tell you're lying Mrs

body language I can tell you're lying

that was better that was better than the

first one better than the first one that

does mean it's good I'm looking for good

anyway number four is uh so authentic

smells number three authentic smells

number three number four we love a lean

oh we love a lean when in the proxic

zones right we're in those four zones if

someone's leaning into you it shows

they're literally trying to cross into

that zone very very subtly and so you'll

notice very highly charismatic people

who you want to be friends with they'll

be like tell me more tell me everything

and they lean in really close to you and

that makes you also feel closer so if

you want to be seen as high and warmth

you can do this as a speaker so you can

lean in as you bold an important Point

like when I'm making an important point

for you I lean into it I'm like listen

to this this is good but if I'm

listening to you and you say something

good I'll be like what really MH so you

can do it as a speaker and as a listener

and it immediately adds more warmth it's

funny okay this might be a little bit of

a tangent but it just came to mind as

you were speaking there are like the odd

person in my life who I've known for

many many years but whenever I'm around

them it kind of goes back to what I was

saying earlier

my body is just off and like I just

don't know what it is like I'm thinking

of one particular person I sh name where

I could be in a room full of people and

I'm relaxed I'm calm whatever and this

person who I've known for many many

years the minute they arrived in the

room I wouldn't be able to be the same

person and I don't know what it is like

my I'd suddenly start think overthinking

my body language and I'd start start

thinking it's how as my legs and it's my

body and I'd start covering blocking a

little bit what is what is that trying

to tell me do I need to cut this person

out my life is there is there like Words

unspoken what is it I would say it means

do more research I I think that gut

feelings are incredibly important

because you know the best queue reading

machine we have is our subconscious

right our our subconscious or

unconscious picking up on lots of cues

that we can't consciously know we can't

consciously know that we're smelling

adrenaline but we are smelling it so I

think that's a very important thing to

pay attention to it doesn't mean you

should cut them out but I think it's

time to do more research are they truly

happy for you are they truly rooting for

you are they secretly angry or jealous

maybe I'm doing it to them it's possible

that you're in a loop with them right

like you're expecting that bad thing and

that expectation becomes reality like

they've studied this that the pigan

effect is real if you expect not to like

someone you send off more unlikable cues

they feel unliked and so they don't like

you either and so it could be that

you're in a loop with this person that

maybe you make them feel the same way

what do I have to do then when next time

I see them cuz I want to dial up I don't

know some warmth with this person or

something or break that cycle okay if I

were you they're they're important to

you yeah they're important to me okay so

I would recommend asking questions that

will level you up with them to level two

so my guess is you might be stuck in

level one with them because you're

obviously uncomfortable with them

research shows that the more

commonalities we have someone the more

that we understand them the more

compassion we have with them the more

that we like someone so I wonder if we

could level up your Rel relationship

with them so you get to know them better

which means you'll like them more and if

you you make it through these six or

seven questions and you still don't like

them then maybe they're not your person

okay okay can I give you some questions

for them please okay please so here my

favorite um I call these level one level

two level three questions in the

framework that I'm researching right now

it's not done yet I have four questions

for each level and I'm working through

these questions but here are the

questions that I think are the the

shortcut to connection okay that if you

ask these questions with your partner

your friend colleagues you're going to

level up with them okay

first are you working on anything

exciting recently

so stop asking what do you do stop

asking how are you stop asking how's it

going that's why you hate people if

you're asking those questions of course

you're going to hate people those are

the most boring questions anyone's ever

asked can I give you a challenge a

challenge here's one Challenge from this

podcast stop asking what do you do for

30 days I want you to go on a what do

you do diet asking what do you do is

telling the person's brain stay on

autopilot d i a last night no no more

we're on a diet okay also asking someone

what do you do is asking what are you

worth and if someone's not defined by

what they do it's actually a rude

question do you know what you're so

right I it's so funny you say this

because yesterday I went to this thing

in New York right and I was introducing

myself to some people and there was one

particular person who I went over to and

we were having a conversation and

halfway through the conversation I went

so what' you do and do you know what

they replied they went this and I just I

went home thinking about it like I was

like I was like of course we're

at work like I bet what I've done there

is I've just belittled what we're doing

right now as if it couldn't possibly

have been what they do right and I just

I I honestly I got in bed last night

thinking about I thought oh God I do you

know what it was I think I was so

impressed by them that I was a bit

awkward yeah and then that just came out

mid sentence what you do yeah God okay

so we're going on a diet everyone from

the next 30 days we're going on a diet

no more what do you do you're going to

replace it with working on anything

exciting these days or working on

anything exciting recent

this is permission connection you ask

someone that question you are giving

them permission if they want to tell you

about what they do oh they will M if

they are not Define about what they do

they'll tell you something better and

that also gives you really good nuggets

for the next time you see them when you

can say hey how was that thing you were

working on that was really exciting

going so start with working on anything

exciting these days working on anything

exciting right now second what's your

biggest goal right now so if you can

especially as we go into the new year or

in the new year right being part of year

I love I ask this question in December

January and February I ask everyone

what's your biggest goal right now

what's your big goal for

2025 when you ask this question you're

going to get one of two responses one

someone shuts you down I don't believe

in goals not my person not my person I'm

a growth-minded person if someone says

that I'm like cool peace we're not going

to get along very well because I have a

lot of goals or they're going to be like

oh let me tell you and they're going to

tell you all about goals that's also a

great thing you can follow up on because

then when you see see them a month later

or a week later or a year later you can

be like hey how did that how did that go

it's a great interview question it's a

great I was just thinking that I should

ask people that in the interview because

Trad yeah because you're right someone

that can't articulate some kind of goal

is probably not my kind of person those

kind of people that go this actually

those kind of people don't listen to

this podcast anyway they just leave

comments and up like yeah exactly

so like it's a very um I call those

allergy questions interesting it's a way

to see are we going to have an allergic

reaction each other it creates an

allergy like I know there's a type of

person it susses them out really quickly

and that's not my kind of person okay so

working anything exciting what's your

goal right now and then this is harder

this is a self-narrative question do we

want to go deeper for a self-narrative

question of course we want to go

that so if we're getting into self-

narrative and you're trying to figure

out yourself or someone else's narrative

you want to ask the question it sounds

innocuous but it's not what book movie

or TV character is most like you and why

it's kind of a silly like dinner party

question it's like sort of sounds casual

but the answer to this question is so

incredibly important and here's an

example how someone relates to

characters their values or personality

is how they see themselves and people's

answers will shock you I'll give you one

example I was friends with someone for

six years one of my closest friends saw

them all the time weekends we went on ad

together we went on weekend trips

together I thought I knew her so well I

was like I know her I asked her this

question and I hypothesize this is all

my research for my next book I was like

I hypothesize she's a mom of three super

funny super Savvy I was like she's going

to pick a great like TV mom character

you know that that that's super Savvy

and funny asked her she thinks about it

for maybe one second and goes catniss

everines from the from the Hunger

Games I was like the one who's like

fighting for her life she's like yeah

that's how I feel every day and we for

the first time in six years had a

conversation about how she feels about

her day that was totally different than

anything I had ever known that she feels

scared and lonely and that she is

fighting for survival and it was the

first time that I truly connected with

her I cannot tell you how many times the

answer to this question has changed for

people in my life and I'm like careful

which examples to use because I'm

worried that they're going to be

watching but has changed my relationship

with people in my life based on how they

see themselves not how I see them but

how they see themselves it's really

interesting

because there's so many people listening

right now that now doing

that and they're discovering maybe for

the first time even how they see

themselves because it's funny because

when you said that obviously I did it in

my head and I was like

 well now I want to know what it is

you like stereotypically no I'll tell

you now I was thinking it's funny cuz

the first person I thought of was Will

Smith because people say I look like him

sometimes right like people you have to

correct someone if someone says who they

look like you say no no look like Valu

personality but then when I thought

about TV characters I actually thought

about Will Smith in the P of happiness

and if you think about his journey he

was broke and he was fighting really

hard to get out of that situation and he

got out of that situation so it goes

back to the personality type you

described at the beginning where like

you hero of your own Journey like where

you've overcome something and you that's

kind of yeah and do you feel you found

it found um found it happiness

are you at the end of the movie I'm at

the end of the

movie

um I don't know if you can ever get to

the end of the movie that's the

struggling with that question because

there's like I think I found it but I've

always I don't know like not the end of

your movie it's not the end of your life

movie but like in that example we could

have a long discussion about like what

what is have you made it so the reason

why I think I'm hesitating is because I

think I think to myself if if I say I've

made it or I'm at the end of the movie

then I'm like it kind of robs me of the

future in a weird way in my head it's

like robbing me of like doing anything

else with my future no because what I

mean yeah yes yes if you feel like the

end of the movie I'm like oh God like

yes no that's true you're never at the

end of the movie but like if you feel

that you've made it it means you have

freedom to pursue things and do work for

meaning as opposed to hitting it yeah of

course yeah like I used to work in call

centers at nighttime selling hotel rooms

and car insurance and artificial grass

and now I get to sit here and have

conversations with people like you and

like people tune in and stuff it's like

if I don't realize at this moment how

much um how much privilege I have I

think I'd be I'd be pretty up so

yeah I do feel like disproportion like

unbelievably fortunate in a way that I

actually don't think I can understand I

think maybe I dreamed of this but to to

be here feels

um feels suspicious

suspicious yeah there a strange word

that came to mind yes it feels

suspicious because

it I don't know you just think you just

think sometimes you think are you worri

it's maybe it is worri but it's also

just

like surely not like it's so so

interesting because I had the dream of

like being successful in business but I

didn't have a dream of or ever imagine

that my life would be like this where

like people know who you are I never had

that dream never imagined it being

possible that was other people for sure

and so also I I that's a very

accurate like that's how I think of Will

Smith in the pursuit of happiness a

little bit is like you never really see

him truly happy in that movie no he's

always just yeah running like that's

something that I that's why I asked like

did you get it you know you've pursued

it you're here of course I'm so chasing

off to something on that's what I think

I can H I don't know what I'm chasing I

wonder what you're chasing after I don't

know actually don't know but I think

that you're interviewing for something

like when I watch your interviews which

are amazing I'm like he's trying to find

the answer to something what is it

always like with every person is a

different thing and actually most of the

answers I'm looking for my own answers

and my general belief is that if I like

authentically go in search of my own

answers which requires some level of

like being open and willing to be uh

open even though there's a lot of people

watching then there'll be lots of other

people out there that are struggling

with the same things or searching for

the same answers as well yes this

interesting I do ask myself a lot what

am I like what's the point like what am

I like what am I but is it not the this

is a bit of a tangent obviously is it

not the case that we should all be

searching

forever like we should all be p in

pursuit of something forever I do love a

quest and I love pursuing and I think

humans are built to pursue things but I

also think I hope I'm not here yet I'm

getting there that there's a point in

our life where we can stop the grind

like I think I'm grinding a little bit

in my career I don't know if you feel

like that like I've made it I feel like

I've made it i' luckier than I ever I

can't believe I get paid to do what I do

but I'm still pursuing uing I hope

there's a point in my life where I can

just be sharing wisdom where I'm not

pursuing anything it's not a number or a

list or it's just like all I'm doing is

sharing wi wisdom and giving out public

education like I think that I'm hopeful

there's a stage of our life where it's

just that it's number five on the one

did Lean which was number four number

five is actually I have to pause on lean

because I wanted to ask you about

something I read in a book um about

peacocking yes so I read read in this

pickup artist book that I read when I

was 18 and some of the videos that I

watched thereafter and some of the other

books that I read thereafter and some of

the other videos I watched thereafter um

about this concept of peacocking where

you can if you're like on a date or

you're interested in a girl or a guy in

a bar if you lean in too much you

signaling low value and like overin and

ever since I learned that I've I've seen

it everywhere and I've seen it in my

friends me and my friends went to like

Mar or somewhere I can't remember it was

many many years ago and there was this

beautiful girl there and we were all

pursuing her yes like that like a

labrador yeah um and I was saying to my

boys there's actually a photo of it on

my phone there me dman and my friend Ash

sat there and we're looking over our

some of our other friends and we're

saying they're peacocking they got no

chance and that's how the story

transpired and then when this beautiful

girl came over to my other friend he was

aware of this peacocking thing he kept

his his neck back he kept his chest back

all these kinds of things he didn't lean

in even though it was loud and closed

closed okay here's why

too much of a lean is bad thing it's

called a bow right if you lean too far

over you get very quickly into bowing or

submissive Behavior we don't like people

who are submissive to us we want equals

and so you're absolutely right what it's

what triggers in the brain if you're

leaning too much is literally I am

subservient to you and that makes

someone who does not want to be in

control or in an unequal relationship

feel very uneasy so that is why too much

of a lean always with these non-verbal

accusers too much of a a good thing you

lean too much it's a considerer a bow

you also don't want to lean the entire

time CU then you look like a hunchback

right I'm laring my value by leaning in

too much and it's distracting like I

want to lean in as a bold or a highlight

if I were to be reading a book and

highlight the entire page the Highlight

means nothing MH if you lean in when

someone's like what really and then I

lean back then it's powerful every

single one of these cues we are using as

a bold or an emphasis or a highlight

just enough of a good thing

okay not too much leaning just use it as

a party trick like a no no I mean no I

mean just use it like as a highlighter

as a highlighter you're highlighting yes

yes yes number five okay five non-verbal

Bridge so this is a concept that I

learned um on the road so I I saw this

in action in a lot of our experiments we

did a big big speed networking

experiment in our lab where we had 500

speed networkers try out different

conversation starters we've recorded

them we coded their conversations and we

looked for patterns of good and bad

conversations and we found there were

certain questions that worked better

than others and there were certain

questions did terribly and one thing we

found is that when people rated a

conversation on a five scale like five

amazing best conversation I had we're

going to connect on LinkedIn I think I

like them the best ones they used a lot

of non-verbal Bridges non-verbal bridges

are when someone is trying to bridge the

distance between you so that could be a

lean lean is one of them but it also

could be a reach out we noticed that in

the good conversations people people

were trying to physically close the

distance between them with hand gestures

with leans with nods with foot movement

with drinks and when they were close

enough they would often do very light

touches on the arms on the shoulder so

have you seen this like on a really good

date have you ever been in a restaurant

like my husband and I like to play this

game where we look and we try to guess

if a couple is very like new couple old

couple how they're doing in a very good

day they are looking for as many

opportunities to touch as they possibly

can that's non-verbal Bridge even if I

were to be like oh let me tell you

something like that slight Reach Out tap

of the knuckles to of the arm that's a

quick saying I'm going to reach into

your intimate Zone but I'm not going

into your intimate Zone and really good

relationships really warm people are

those they are bridging all the time

they walk by you they touch your

shoulder they say how's it going hey I

want to thinking about you like they're

constantly doing these very small

Bridges and that couldn't might not be

actual a physical touch it could even be

the the look of a touch like one thing

that I teach my students who are

uncomfortable with touch is you can even

touch without touching that sounds

really weird but like put your arm

closer to me so I can demo it for you so

like pretend that we're a dinner I could

be like oh my gosh really okay so you

didn't touch me my hand but it did the

same thing yeah not quite oxy did yeah

but kind you like I get it yeah she's

trying to close the intimacy of the

distance so non-verbal Bridges trying to

reach out reach into someone's space

very briefly and come back trying to

lean into someone's face very briefly

this is why giving people things or

serving people is such a warm thing you

hand someone a drink like you come to my

office I offer you hot hot chocolate I

offer you tacos I want to break the

social scripts I want to give you

something different and I'm looking for

reasons to serve you you give people

tacos at your office yeah I'm in Austin

Texas

strange you would like it you would like

it if you were hungry you'd be like give

me that taco give me that taco it's what

I don't know if that's office food but

each to their own um so hugging and

stuff like that you know there's this

thing that people talk a lot about which

is awkward hugging and sometimes you hug

someone and you just feel like oh they

didn't like that I didn't like that that

was bad for both of us yeah horrible can

we address the hug issue please okay you

need to Signal what kind of greeting you

want from the moment someone first sees

you you can stop awkward greetings from

happening with simple non-verbal cues

here's what they are you want a

handshake so good to see you I want you

to be doing this from 10 feet away so

good to see you I'll come in with it

yeah you're literally signaling to

someone up so good to see you right this

immediately signals their brain don't

try to give me an awkward hug don't side

hug me don't hug me we're hand shaking

it is a very clear way to be like it's

called blading so we angle our body a

little bit forward and we put one hand

out you know I'm coming in for a

handshake if you want a hug and you're a

hugger it's so good to see you it's so

good to see you okay arms out arms out

and that's also going to prevent

the awkward side hug the worst thing you

can do is like this which is a kind of

but what but one arm up people are like

do I shake it do I side hug are we going

to are we going to hug are we going to

high five are we going to fist bump if

you want a fist bump you're coming in

with a fist bump from very hugger cuz I

don't always it context dependent I do

not like hugging people when I first

meet meet them I was pitching a TV show

about recovering awkward people at a

very big Network and I walk into the

pitch room and at that point I was a

hugger or I was I thought I should hug

because that was one of thing it's in la

la people are Huggers and cheat kissers

a lot and so I was like I walk into say

oh it's so nice to meet you I'm a hugger

oh yeah and then Z goes I'm not oh

just cringe oh God just I died inside I

died inside and you know what that pitch

went terribly do I have a TV show called

recovering awkward person no I don't

that's cuz I think I hugged him and I

went forward with it too much warmth too

much warmth not enough

competence and so I will never do that

again so now I never ever say I'm a

hugger and I always offer my hand now if

someone says to me oh but I'm a hugger

and they wave my hand away no problem no

problem that's interesting if we take

that back to the Charisma framework of

warmth and competence it is signaling a

little bit too much a lot of warmth it's

a lot of warmth and I know a lot about a

person when they tell me I'm a hugger

what you know go high warm High warmth

probably a people pleaser overeager

really want to connect probably feel

lonely a little bit afraid and I want to

make them feel as liked as

possible gosh that's a lot just from

that one sentence I've hugged a lot of

people no it is also I you know I have

amazing students you know we have

millions of views on our YouTube channel

and they feel like they know me and so

if they want to hug me I'm totally okay

with it because I've been in their bed

I've been in their living room I've been

in their kitchen TV on their phone I've

shared my stories with them and I

understand why they want to hug me

because we feel like friends and that

actually is a compliment and you like it

I do like it like when a student says oh

my gosh I love you I love Captivate I'm

like come

here it feels like a friend so on the

hugging point then as well is there like

is there a great way to hug someone I

mean yeah how how is that have you been

told you're a good hugger because then

you might not be I've tried to work on

it so I think I think I am now okay I

actually have been told I am okay but

it's it's part of the reason why is

because I've learned a lot from doing

this podcast and someone told me don't

tap on the back don't tap on the back

and they told me to like we don't like

being tapped on the head we don't like

being tapped on the back it's a

submissive cue right it's like you

you'll notice um Power Players in

politics Will sometimes deme someone by

going hey bud yeah yeah yeah it's so we

yeah definitely don't hug um so you're

going to want to approach equally you

don't want any kind of asymmetry in your

hug right so that's why you want to

approach someone like this like no

asymmetry none of this straight on um

you so this is hard if you are taller

than the person you typically want to go

up like you want to avoid like the who's

going up right so the taller person

should always try to go up and you want

to like literally angle up the lower

person is going to angle down and you're

going to try to go torso to

torso okay

and I like a two second hug by the way

there is research on the length of

handshakes I haven't seen research on

the length of hugs but a handshake

should be between one and three pumps

and one and three or one and three

seconds so for example we're saying at

one two three that's good and typically

they found that if we do a 3se second

Shake it's with a new person so our

first Shake was about 3 seconds because

we didn't know each other but if I were

to see you again like oh it's so good to

see

you okay you do okay so typically if you

already know someone you're just like

doing a quick reading it's a 1 second

and if you don't know someone it's a 3

second what if

I your face as I got to four seconds

you're like offended you're like not my

person you like you like cussed me out

of your eyes yeah was like horrible

that's how I feel getting my arm back

you also want to make sure that when

you're doing a handshake you're offering

um thumb up thumb up is really important

um you'll notice certain political power

players will um hear if yeah that so

they'll flip you oh Donald Trump yes you

and he like really pulls and he'll pull

you he'll pull you off I never shaking

hands with him so I don't know but um

I've watched many many a video and he'll

shake your hand turn you up this is a

very vulnerable place to be we don't

like it as humans to have this these

arteries up so we'll he'll flip so he'll

he'll flip and he'll pull you off there

it doesn't feel good does it but what

does that signal does that signal

competence and strength no I don't think

it's either I actually think it's a

danger C okay CU it's purposely I don't

none of the cues I teach are

manipulative in that way like that is

purposely trying to get someone off

balance like to give them dis

equilibrium I like relationships to be

equal that's why I want you to offer

thumb up I want I also don't want you to

open you know offer your hand like you

know up where you're saying I'm going to

be submissive to you we don't like that

right so thumb up I think I can't

remember where I learned it but I

learned that if you cut then it's

signaling warmth so abely I was going to

cup earlier on but I was holding some

stuff I remember thinking I sat there

and on cup why did I get my cup because

I was holding all your books so I I was

holding your books I was like I can't

imagine if I TR to cup with your books I

was just thr so strange no so cupping is

really warm it's double the warmth it's

double the oxytocin it's like a hand hug

so it's super high in warmth it's also

called the politician's handshake so you

only want to do it if you are truly and

genuinely trying to show warmth

otherwise it can come across as forced

okay I also speaking of like weird

signals I've heard this about men that

men to men have two different kinds of

nods tell me if you think this is true

so if you walk down the hallway and you

see a man you know you go hey nod up if

you see a man you don't know you go

morning and you no down oh that's

interesting and supposedly it's because

a person you know you're willing to

expose this part of your neck but if you

don't know someone you want to keep your

chin down and your but you're still

acknowledging them is that true well do

you know what's funny is um the way that

I think about it is if I see a black guy

guy okay out and about okay pretty much

anywhere and they they know me whatever

they'll typically do that up there's

something about I don't I don't know if

I'm just making this up but there's

something about like being part of they

I can see them from across the room have

no idea who they are and in group it's

like a I see you me and you are and I

trust you it's a way of being like I'm

willing to expose this I trust you oh

okay so interesting interesting so I've

noticed that women don't do that okay so

that's oh yes KN down is I see you

stranger okay morning so interesting got

noted so interesting so so

interesting I'm a a CEO um I do speaking

on stage you you speak on stage as well

you're very very good at it is there

anything that I should know if I'm a

leader in a business or I'm a public

speaker that I should be thinking most

about when I'm up on stage to signal I

don't know whatever I want to signal to

get whatever I want yes purposeful

movement a big mistake I see CEOs make

on stage is they either don't have

purposeful movement so they Pace the

stage back and forth or they're stuck in

one point and they don't move from that

point and it makes them look very stiff

I believe you should block your speeches

just very subtly so for example I always

when I deliver I start in the middle of

the stage always always so when I'm

being introduced right your first few

seconds on stage is the most important

for your entire talk so as you're being

introduced you walk on stage pick a

point and walk purposefully to it don't

Meander on the stage you're walking

right to the middle of the stage or the

left of the stage however you pick and

you're delivering your first opening

lines opening story in that Middle Point

that's where I like it and that

intention walking on stage is going to

make you look so much more confident and

not disorganized or um ambiguous then if

you can this is for the advanced speaker

and this is you I think you want to help

your audience with your stage movement

so in my presentations when I'm sharing

science or fact or research I'm on the

left hand side of the stage when I'm

moving to personal story gifts anecdotes

or a funny video I'm on the right side

of the stage that is a way I'm helping

my audience organize and categorize my

talks I've also noticed in the audience

there are highly warm people and there

are highly competent people I've noticed

if I train them that way I'm doing a

60-minute keynote they they begin to

subconsciously recognize it my highly

competent folks perk right up I get to

the left side of stage oh this is for me

and my highly warm folks are like ha my

turn and it really helps them know when

to pay the most attention so you should

think about for your talks you also can

do this chronologically so some of my

students are like Ted speakers and

they're telling more of a chronological

story as opposed to like making points I

will often teach them to start like we

like to you know in in Western cultures

we read from left to right I like them

to actually start on the left hand side

of the stage or the audience's left

because the beginning of their story

starts here and they share their

childhood there's pictur of their

childhood on the slide and they slowly

begin to move over to the middle when

the middle part of their Journey happens

and they finally get to their Arc their

knowledge their ah they finally they

made it over to the far side of the

stage the far right side of the stage

and in terms of what I'm saying we

talked a little bit about the actual

content of what I'm saying because this

applies not just to when I'm on stage

but also to emails and whatsapps and I

think most of our communication these

days is on a screen so if I'm trying to

be a master of structuring a sentence on

a screen to set people up for Success

okay what what like what is what have I

got to be thinking

about what emotion do you want your

person to feel when they see your name

in their inbox on stage in LinkedIn MH

that is the emotion that you want to

label

yourself so for example in your talks

like for example in my talks I am trying

to acknowledge the pain of awkwardness I

don't want people to feel like they are

unseen so when I say you're overlooked

you're misunderstood you're

underestimated you feel awkward and out

of control and anxious and overwhelmed I

hear you you're not alone I've been

there and then the solution to that

feeling the where it gets better is

confidence and presence and memorability

and the mechanism is Blueprints and

formula and hard skills that helps me

gift to the audience a solution emotion

so for you I would say what are the pain

points you want your audience to

resonate with so they feel heard by you

seen by you understood by you what's the

goal emotion that you want to give them

from your talk from your podcast from

the email that they're subscribing to

and then what's your mechanism what's

your way that you do that

imperfection so imperfection I was I was

watching a video of yours I think from

10 years ago where you were sat with two

lovely people talking about Charisma and

one of the things you said earlier in

the video is that I think it was like TV

shop or something like that where like a

lady made a mistake she like spilled a

milkshake or something and she did more

sales because she spilled a milkshake

yes that's it explain this to me yes

another study by Dr Richard wisman who

wanted to know do you have to be perfect

which for many years I wanted to be

perfect and then I realized oh there is

no such thing as perfect and I don't

want to be that way very simple he had a

model selling a blender in a mall and in

one version she had the perfect pitch

and now take your strawberries and your

bananas and just the button and here you

have perfect smoothies and the second

one she he had same smoothie same pitch

same verbal but she spills the Smoothie

on the table as she's pouring it people

bought more of the blender when she

spilled the

Smoothie now does this mean I want you

to perfectely spill your smoothies no I

did have a piece of kale in my teeth

earlier and I really considered coming

in with it just to see what would happen

I did I did I did think about it but I

didn't do it but I do think there's like

stop trying to be perfect own your

authentic vulnerabilities don't

purposely smell a smoothie don't

purposely smell your coffee by the way

that that experiment was repeated with

coffee and job interviews if I remember

correctly they had an audio clip um and

hirers were raing job candidates on

performance and in one of the audio

clips they had him spill his coffee oh

whoops o oops oops sorry about that

spill my coffee let's get that and then

go back to the interview and they raided

that candidate as a better candidate

even though he spilled his coffee why

it's called the other shoe effect

we know that every no one's perfect we

know this it's impossible and so when

we're interacting with someone even on a

commercial even interview we're like

what's wrong with

you what is your

imperfection and it kind of distracts us

that this research the other shoe effect

found the longer the interview goes on

without something dropped like without

the other shoe to drop the more the

interviewer is like H what's going on

here and the more they'll try to ask

questions to try to find it you are

better off in an interviewer on a date

dropping your

shoe so sharing whatever that

vulnerability or imperfection is closer

to the start of the interview or the

date because it helps the other person a

get to know you better but also not be

so worried that they're not seeing your

true

imperfection Captivate when I first

wrote it my intro was really really

boring and my publisher I love her Nikki

my editor wrote back and she's like

Vanessa your intro doesn't sound like

you it sounds like you're trying to be

something you're not and she was right I

was trying to sound like an academic

researcher I'm not an academic

researcher I'm a behavior researcher I'm

a pop scientist I'm a recovering awkward

person she's like start with that so the

opening line of captivate is hi I'm

Vanessa I'm a recovering awkward person

that is why that book hit the bestseller

list I dropped the shoe yes I teach

Charisma yes I teach body language I am

still in recovery I am still constantly

worried that people hate me I have a

small and wonderful group of friends but

otherwise people make me still nervous I

know how to deal with it I how to make

convers

but I want you to know there's still

awkwardness here no matter how many of

these you learn you're probably still

going to face awkwardness and overwhelm

but at least it will be a little bit

easier so I think it's really important

that we plan to share our Perfections

and not try to hide it weal branding

uhuh is a big thing now because we have

social media we have LinkedIn it's a big

part of what gets you a job and gets you

opportunities and gets you speaking

appointments and book deals Etc so

everybody is uh well most people are

playing the game of personal branding to

some degree yeah so as you were saying

about um being perfect and showing

imperfections again it feels like

there's a there's like a uh like a is

gradient the right word like a spectrum

that's a nice word for sure you can go

too far with imperfection oh yeah me and

my friends call this deficiency

promotion what and then on the other end

of the spectrum you've got ideas

promotion which is like when you're all

about like look how smart I am and these

are my ideas and deficiency promotion is

look how traumatized broken sick ill I

am and you build a whole brand around

that yeah and you can like you know so

you're probably still going to get

speaking appointments either side

because you know they're going to want

people to speak about this stuff but

also this stuff but I think you have to

be quite intentional about how you show

up on this spectrum well first of all

what's true right like the very first

question is like don't purposely s spill

the Smoothie but you know what's

interesting is when you build a brand it

becomes self-reinforcing so I see people

on both sides of the spectrum maybe they

started in the middle and then they got

likes and followers that are like get go

further like what else is wrong with you

that's why we love you you're so Bren

toally totally I think that there are

people who are locked into being broken

and being messy and people don't want to

see them Triumph however I think it is

important to show people if you are very

broken and in a bad point in a bad stage

in your life like show it and then show

them how you're a hero out of it that

can Inspire other Heroes I agree but is

there such a thing as spending too long

in either Camp do you know what I mean

cuz we like a little bit of oh you had a

bad day great but you have a bad life is

Different Strokes for different folks I

think there are people who would stay

all over there forever yeah but if

you're there for 10 years where you're

just every day you're showing up like

another day for me for 10 years

think they would still get likes I think

would they would course they would

Conant I mean it would be Mis miserable

for you as a person but if that's your

brand that's your brand I guess I guess

you said that the most important thing

which is like who are you yeah like if

that's the truth if you're you're having

a decade of then be honest you got a

decade of you got a decade of

it it's interesting with social media

that I think social media started in a

place where it was you know the marger

on the beach and that that was in such

high Supply that something else became

in Greater Supply which was being a bit

more honest and stretch marks on the

beach yeah exactly stretch marks on the

beach that's exactly what happened and

those are people who' have gone viral

from those kind of posts I would I do

want to say something about personal

branding I think about it a little bit

differently um so in the very last

section of cues I talk about visual

um we have to remember that the cues in

our brand the colors we wear what's

behind you in your background the props

you're holding in your picture what's

back behind you in your videos they are

triggering neural networks so for

example they've research this if I say

free associate to fire Tru you might say

red engine dog and you might start to

associate different words there are

really common neural networks so what

you want to think about is what what

neural networks are you triggering in

your personal brand so for example I

like you to create strong neural

networks all my single students my

students who are dating I say your

profile picture should be triggering all

kinds of neural networks that you like

so if you love skiing you should be on a

slope holding skis because for some

people that will trigger a fierce fear

neural network right like I'm not a

skier I see skis I'm like cold scared

alone

right like knees hurting like that's

what I think when I see skis I would not

be a good partner for them but someone

else is going to be like Adventure

family fun vacations that's your person

every picture on your profile should be

creating allergies and attractors should

be activating neural networks for your

person you want them to have similar

neural networks to you my husband and I

I think if you were to show us both

pictures of the same things we would

have very similar neural networks for

different vacations different props

different foods different activities and

that's because we have similar ways of

thinking we are very different but we

activate the same similar neural

networks for pain and pleasure okay I

had a conversation with a really good

friend of mine about this okay um they

are looking for a partner okay and they

are approaching their 40s and they were

asking me about their Instagram and the

first thing I noticed about their

Instagram is I would say 80% of pictures

they're holding a cocktail or a drink of

alcohol now as I looked at the Instagram

I go oh party go I don't think like

settle down and let's have a family

absolutely does she want to have a

family yes okay wrong pictures okay she

is activating the wrong neural networks

for men she's dating men yeah she's

dating the wrong you're men are going to

look at that and be like party girl fun

out not the mother of my children so

those are creating allergies for the

ideal man so what does she need to

change she needs okay so what kind of

husband and father does she want does

she want an outdoor lover a good one

that can she she said to me I want a

good one that that can help me with some

of these overheads overheads

bills she doesn't want him to pay all

the bills she just wants some help with

the bills okay so okay so a hard

worker she ears a lot of money okay so

that's pictures of her you know working

hard at a conference what kind of way

does she spend to her weekend she's

hiking or she's biking or she's running

across the Brooklyn Bridge or she's

running a marathon or she's loves with

dogs or she loves cats or she's eating

big waffles and pancakes like she should

be taking pictures of what she wants to

do with her partner so that they look at

that and they're like I want to join her

for that and you also want to create

allergies you don't want to appeal to

everyone cuz you're going to go on bad

dates the other thing I know about this

person is is something you said about

earlier it's just their their body

language as I think about it is just so

it's like trying to take up less space

is any way I can describe it contracted

exactly like that right so so when we

talk about distance between like so ear

ear ear L and shoulder distance number

one second distance is important between

your arm and your torso in a good

conversation we have distance that's

fluctuating a lot like right I'm talking

my arms are going out you're seeing

distance between my torso and my arm

people who are very anxious yeah like in

like just like a pencil or like penguin

I call it penguin where they like don't

ever release their arms from their torso

and they're very contracted they have

very minimal hand gestures and they'll

often clutch something to their chest

now if I were to give the entire

interview like this you would think oh

man she is nervous or she's um you know

afraid or she's anxious because I don't

have that space the moment I release

that space it makes me look more

confident so

that's the other distance you can play

with hand gestures really help with that

handes help with space with vocal

variety with comprehension that's why I

like them so much so if I'm trying to

get her a husband I'd like to we've been

friends for a long time almost a decade

and I have sat in the passenger seat of

her life and tried to be a supportive

friend in any way but if I tried to give

her advice in terms of cues and body

language and sentences on how to get a

partner where do we start okay so one

let's get her some pictures that are

going to attract the right person and

create allergies for the wrong person

okay two her main profile pictures

should be showing warm and competent

body language yeah authentic smile maybe

a head tilt maybe you have a hand

gesture maybe that's too much warmth I

want to see a lot of space between your

earlobe and your shoulder make sure it's

a symmetrical smile make sure we're not

contempt make sure we're not

accidentally fear smiling right so the

profile picture is number one most

important yes

okay you're laugh it's a lot okay oh we

we it's going to be hard we got to find

her her husband we haven't got much time

yet that okay we got we got to find her

husband the interpersonal body language

is really hard as a friend to correct on

someone may I ask you does she use vocal

fry what's that does she ever talk like

this where it's kind of like a frying

pan where she's not using her full voice

typically people who use contracted

small body language often have that kind

of a vocal power and so they go into a

pattern like this and then and like oh

like I mean I just like watered the

plants this weekend and like also the

inton the um the end of this sentence

goes up right so that's the first thing

I would actually try to help her with is

um making sure that she does not

accidentally use vocal fry it's usually

an accident here's the fastest way to

get vocal fry rid of vocal fry if you

are using it you hear yourself using it

or someone else is using it just speak

louder vocal fry happens from a lack of

breath what actually is happening is

you're speaking in your vocal cords are

rattling it's a terrible noise but

that's it's my vocal cords rattling

together and the moment that I speak

louder it goes away it goes away so

often times when we're lacking

confidence or we have tight body we have

less breath and we create vocal fry so

just ask her to speak up a little bit

okay it's hard to get someone to stand

more broadly because if they're

uncomfortable with it they don't like it

so what I would recommend is she should

do activity dates when you're at dinner

with someone or at brunch or at coffee

at a bar you're like this so what do you

do and you're like shriveled and you're

like clutching your drink and you're in

your patterns you're in those patterns

go on Hikes go play pickle ball go learn

pickle ball go play ping pong like do

something physical because then it's

much easier to be

broad interesting okay that makes a lot

of sense actually yeah because you're

going to if it's in a context you're

super familiar with you the old patterns

are going to be triggered in you yes and

I've tried to get people to stand more

broadly just by telling them and it can

it helps the awareness helps but it's

much easier when you're actually in a

context that helps you be that way I

read a study um from your work that said

in a study to see how men and women look

at body language differently they put

people in an MRI machine and had them

try and read body language um from just

pictures alone what happened what did

they find out so I believe women

activated 14 to 16 areas of their brain

activated while trying to read those

body language pictures and Men I believe

it was half of that in other words when

women were looking at pictures of body

language lots of connections were

happening they were making predictions

they were thinking about personality

they were thinking about emotions they

were looking at their clothes they were

looking at their facial structure women

were taking a much broader picture of

the body language whereas men were I

think much more Q focused ah broad

shoulders feet apart hands visible

neither of these are right or wrong

actually in fact men can sometimes be

easier to teach like my students are 50

men and women but sometimes men can they

can focus in on the cue that I'm trying

to teach them they can understand it

they can comprehend it got it it's

decoded women tend to create a whole

narrative so I play game sometimes with

my students where I say okay tell me

about someone he has a

mohawk and men will often say I don't

let them hear the women first men will

often be like he has a

mohawk he's a man he's not bald women

will be like okay he's a bad boy and he

probably has has earrings and I bet you

he drives a motorcycle and I bet he'd be

really fun on a date but probably a

drinker and they will just go

interesting so this is it's good and bad

right like that also can hinder women

and by the way I'm making a big

generalizations on this this is not the

the generalization part we have to make

sure we're careful on women tend to

globalize a queue like they'll see a

queue and be like oh that means he's bad

or that means he's dangerous I'm never

he's toxic never gonna talk to him yeah

um whereas men will sometimes you know

oh it's probably a bad day or I'll I'll

give her or him a second chance so we

just have to be a little bit aware of

our own interpr our own lenses we'll say

is there anything else that I should say

to my friend in in order to help them

because sometimes I wonder you know

there's tips tricks tactics they can

lean they can do this whatever but is

there something deeper that is easier

and you know why I say this that book

the game I went off to University I

lasted for one lecture but while I was

there I met this guy called Joe my

friend I won't say his second name cuz

will identify him but I met my friend

Joe and I said to Joe listen my friend I

said this book The Game really useful

Tau me a lot about like you know

interpersonal um Dynamics you should

read it gave the book to him he read it

we went out to the club that day he

 it up like he went out there he

he started negging people insulting

people whatever and I just thought God

you know you just can't teach it that's

what I thought I thought there's so many

and actually when I reflect on the

people in my life this guy called Dan

I'll say his name Dan Capon Dan Capon in

school was always just so so good with

the opposite sex he was just always he's

one of those people he's charismatic he

was funny he's like that cocky funny

yeah yeah just a natural no one taught

him that yeah and so I look at my friend

Joe I look at my friend Dan I go you it

doesn't matter if you read the book

because I'm not saying your book your

book's amazing everyone needs to go read

your books no they really do it's a

great book but I'm saying is there

something deeper within us like for my

friend that has the shriveled posture

yeah is it just like tactics and tips I

think anyone can learn it okay I I

really truly believe that I have seen

the most awkward uncomfortable people

totally shut

down slowly transform or completely

transform and remember they don't who is

your uncharismatic friend what was the

fake first name you used he's not he's

not uncharismatic he just I just gave

him the book and he just like who is Joe

Joe Joe doesn't need to have a complete

transformation to find his soulmate Joe

does not need to have a complete

transformation to have friends you're

his friend so even if he has a couple of

tactics like stop asking what do you do

it's boring M like start making eye

contact especially the end of sentences

for 60 70% of the time oh people

suddenly feel listen to hey ask better

questions to your friends you'll get to

know them better those tactics will get

him friendships hopefully a girlfriend

hopefully a job so I think that everyone

can make small or big changes I don't

think there's anyone who's unteachable

do you think there's a relationship

between these tactics and tips and your

actual confidence I.E does it become

like a

self-reinforcing yes so much so like

that is the only way I found confidence

the only way that I was able to conquer

my awkwardness and actually begin to go

out and try to make friends and be less

lonely I mean I was so lonely was that I

was like okay I have a goal I'm going to

ask someone one what have you been doing

that's been exciting recently I'm going

to ask that question that gave me just

enough confidence to get out the door

and to get to that party and then when I

got a good answer someone's like oh yeah

you know I am working on something

exciting I was like oh and then they

felt excited I felt excited and so like

that one tool gave me enough confidence

to go out so these tools give you

confidence to try something new and to

break your pattern if you feel stuck and

this is for anyone if you feel stuck

then you have to try something different

if you keep doing the same thing you're

going to keep getting the same thing so

that means you have to ask different

kinds of questions you have to use

different kind of body language cues and

if you're willing to try just something

different something will change for

you is are these cues this body language

more important for one gender typically

than the other not that I've seen not

the research has not found that good for

both and what's in terms of

Attraction is what is do you think the

most important thing is it competent is

it strong is it okay so this is not this

is research so I believe it was Monica

Moore who did this research she found

that the people who got approached the

most at clubs the people who got

approached the most were just had the

biggest signal of

availability so they weren't the most

attractive men and women she did this

for both men and women they were not the

most attractive men and women in fact

the most attractive women in the in the

room if they had closed body language

closed off Body Language they were not

approach they did not get dates they did

not get out their number it was the men

and women who signaled I'm available

how' you signal one available okay so uh

this is really important for dating in

the sense of wanting to be approach

dating one to one is a little bit

different right you don't need to Signal

this if you're one to one but if you're

in a big room or you're speed networking

one is open body no blocking I never

want anything in front of your torso I

don't want this I don't so I don't want

arms crossed I don't want Cup in front

of you I don't want you clutching your

computer or your iPad or your phone I

want you to make sure that your torso is

open and angled out towards the room I

like croissant feet you know

parallel feet are like what we're doing

right now in a dating situation I want

you to have croissant feet which is your

your feet are angled toward the biggest

part of the room saying I'm open come

and approach me okay that signals to

both men and women oh maybe that person

is literally physically open to someone

coming in and breaking this conversation

it also means small darting glances to

everyone around the room everyone

everyone you want to approach you oh

everyone you want to approach you yeah

how many times do someone got to do a

glance to get someone to come over so

mon Moore actually studied this I

believe it took eight glances to get

someone to approach don't quote me on

that it was it was way higher than I

thought like I was like two maybe three

I think it was something insane like

eight could you imagine being in a bar

and looking at someone eight times

that's how many times it took to get

that person to come over and these are

quick glances not like you know cat like

it's a it's a side glance it's a side

glance and a smile it's a flip of the

hair and a look over right those are the

kind of glances that we're talking about

and there it takes eight sometimes so

croissant feet open body quick short

glances I would also try one of my

secret tricks for daters is um generally

gesturing in their Direction so like

let's see like like there's a hot guy

right over there that I can see i' I've

been married for 18 years just to be

okay yeah um if you want you okay drop

something you called him hot you called

him hot he's freaking

out okay so there's a hot guy right over

there that I want to see and I'm talking

to you I might make some quick

glances over but I also might like when

I'm gesturing I'm sort of gesturing

towards them so I'm on their line of

gesturing so like if I'm gesturing out

I'm I'm making a gesture for them to

literally come over like I'm like

gesturing and then I'm like I want them

to like literally come over I'm sort of

gesturing but I'm talking but I'm open

gesturing ah interes it work if they are

attracted to you at all they will come

over if they don't come over they're

probably not attracted do you try

someone else what about men how do men

signal in this oh sorry same same so

like a man can the same thing now women

are less likely to approach men in a

crowded environment culturally that's

not as accepted so it's going to be

harder to for a man to get a woman to

come over but it does work very well for

men to warm a woman up that you she is

about to be approached with those things

quick glances open gestures croissant

feet towards her that way when you do

approach she knows that your attention

has been on her and look at her

responses to your gestures and your

glances if she meets your glance great

if she turns away from you turns her

feet away from you she's not probably

very receptive to your approach so it's

a good way to kind of test the waters

before you actually approach it's

difficult in this day and age isn't it

to know if you can roll up on someone

because there's a lot of like you know

too cool for school that's what I see

and also there's like a big culture now

of inappropriate

advances yes but I'm going to be

optimistic and say look I'm not single

so I I know that's different but I think

people are lonely and I think people so

want to meet their person so if you are

actually in person and you were

interested in

someone it is such a gift to go up to

someone and be like hey I like you I saw

you across the

room J I think I said this on one or two

podcasts before but I didn't really get

a answer from anybody I had this kid at

this event that I spoke at okay and he

was in the front R it just it really

moved me because it made me realize that

there's so many people out there

especially in the world we live in now

in 2024 for 2025 or whatever who want

friends you just said loneliness right

they want to make her friend and it's so

weird this kid stood up bless him in

this talk I was doing and he put his

hands up in the air and there's a

thousand people um around him it was

this talk I did in Canary wolf in London

which is like it's like New York of

London it's like really really busy

they're all wearing suits these kids

because they work in the city and he

stood up and he went my question is how

do I make friends oh and you can imagine

the guts it takes to say that in front

of a room of a thousand people

he went how do I make friends what' you

say do you have any friends do I have

any friends I have a couple not many but

it's funny because what I actually said

it took me off took me off guard but

what I ended up saying was what you just

did is how you make friends you know

what I'm saying so like that that

willingness to be vulnerable in that way

because I said I know what's going to

happen after I finish on stage here and

walk off people are going to come up to

you yeah yeah okay so I have a framework

for how to make friends as adults okay I

think it's really important I think it's

somehow acceptable in our society to

approach friendship like dating but

that's how we should think about it is

meeting two or three amazing people is

so important for your health for your

happiness for your success it is so

important to date your friends like that

is incredibly important one of my best

friends is Cody Sanchez because she is

incredibly inspiring incredibly smart

incredibly funny but I dated a lot of

people in Austin a lot of girls in

Austin to find her I know she did too it

was my bachelorette for friends era

where I was looking for girlfriends and

we just like hit it off and like we've

been able to grow our businesses

together so one is you should change

your mindset finding friends is like

dating you are looking for your friend

soulmate and then you should approach

those friends just like you would a

potential partner you want someone with

similar values you want Sim someone who

activates the same neural networks as

you they like the same activities and

you want someone who you test it out you

would never move in with a friend or

never move with someone who just started

dating same thing with a friend you

don't want to get too close too fast

so I highly recommend go on friendship

dates and you want them to be different

every time take them to places that you

love and try to make them a little bit

allergic so for example there's a place

this is going to sound crazy but it

works so there's a place in Austin

called uh Casa Delo if anyone's been

there in Austin and it's a vegan hippie

spot it's been there forever and you go

in and it's one meal You Can't customize

it and they plop it down on your tray

and you eat it like a cafeteria food and

I love it and I love taking really high

maintenance women there just to see what

they're going to do because the the

women who are like can I please get a

not a I'm like we're not going to be

friends we cannot be friends you don't

like those people nope that modified

them that's why I left La mm I mean you

can modify a little bit but like there's

a way that you kind do it and here you

can't you literally cannot modify and so

it's interesting to see how people deal

with that circumstance and I found my

best closest friends are like cool let's

go with it like that's a way that that I

see very into their personality that's

like a very weird story people are going

to be like she's so weird no wonder she

doesn't have any friends true I don't

have a lot of friends but the friends I

have I love we go to C all the time so

you should think about activities or

places with your friends where you're

going to be able to test out a value or

something that you really appreciate in

friends what if you don't have friends

I'm thinking about this kid like and

especially if you're a man because men

just struggle more it's it's it's it

actually feels awkward sometimes

when I make dates for my hband I I have

to get make dates friend dates for my

husband as well no I totally get I see

it um activities so like where's the

place you like to hang out what's the

thing that you do is it you know axe

throwing is it going to soccer games is

it crazy mileage runs is it hiking group

is it pickle ball like find the activity

you love and then just slowly just like

we're talking about dating slowly hit

them up work on anything exciting these

days what's your big goal for 2025 like

those are the questions the reason I

have these questions is they're dating

questions but they're also friendship

questions if you live in that activity

for long enough you'll find your people

what are you seeing in terms of

interpersonal relationship shifts in the

sort of 15 years has it been since

you've been 18 years you you must have

seen societal level shifts in our

interpersonal skills our friendships Etc

what are you saying airpods are killing

friendship airpods are going to ruin our

interpersonal interactions and here's

the difference I've seen that biggest

difference the last 18 years 18 years

ago you could maybe wear a Walkman

around campus or around the city or on a

subway but really your ears were open

and so what would happen is you get on

the subway or you'd walk across campus

or you'd walk down the hallway and

someone would be like Hey Stephen how's

it going you know pretty good crazy week

oh really what you working on like it

was so much easier to have those tiny

micro moments of connection that van

Sloan study was done before airpods and

I wonder if you were to redo it now it

would happen which one that the the one

where he found the most likable kids had

the longest list of people they liked

and in the study the most likable kids

when he observed them they were walking

down the hallway saying hello chatting

next to someone for 5 seconds at a

locker saying after class and sort of

talking sitting with a lunch table

leaning over someone asking about that

so much micro connection very small

conversations our friendships don't

often happen in these big deep

conversations they happen in these micro

moments airpods destroy it and I see

this especially with younger folks

because they always have their airpods

in when they're commuting when they're

walking when they're jogging when

they're at the gym I don't know about

when I was single for 5 seconds when I

was like you know 17 the gym was like

the place like at the gym no one really

was listening to anything at the gym at

least I can remember like the rare

person would have their Walkman in but

everyone was airpod free and so there

was a lot of micro moments of connection

happening it was so much easier to talk

to people now if someone's working out

with their out their airpods they

they're insane I'm like what are they

doing they should go home it's weird

it's weird or they're with a friend

working out together and that's

intimidating so I'm

worried about this because we need weak

ties week ties are in the research these

very casual connections of someone you

see at the gym once a week and you kind

of know them oh yeah you know Stephen

nice to see you you recognize their face

that when you were if you were to see

them at a restaurant later in the week

You' be like hey don't you go to that

gym oh yeah yeah we do so what are you

doing this weekend like those week ties

are incredibly important for our

happiness that's how we build big

friends that's how we can find a

soulmate that's how we can make good

business contacts and I'm seeing less

and less of that because of airpods and

because of hybrid work so we're just not

in the office that much so we're having

less of those little micro moments in a

hallway that five minutes before a

meeting starts the five minutes before a

meeting start is really critical to your

Career Success how you talk to your boss

the small talk you make are you asking

boring questions it's telling your

colleagues and your boss a lot about who

you are and it's proven likable people

make more money likable people get more

promotions likable people have more

friends and more friends at work and so

when we have less moments to show how

likable we are it's really hard to get

those

things at my company flight Studio which

is part of my bigger company flight

group we're constantly looking for ways

to build deeper connections with our

audiences whether that's a new show a

product or a project it's why I launched

the conversation cards I've relied on

Shopify before who's a sponsor of

today's podcast and I'll be using them

again for the next big launch which

we'll hear about soon and I use them

because of how easy it is to set up an

online store that reaches all of you no

matter where you are in the world with

Shopify the usual pain points of

launching products online Disappear

business Shopify has everything you need

if you're an entrepreneur you're

probably going to want to listen to this

it's a message from one of our sponsors

on this podcast which is LinkedIn if

you've listened to me on this podcast

for a while now you'll know that I've

been on a bit of an evolution as a

business owner and entrepreneur and one

of those Evolutions that has become

clearer and clearer as I've matured is

that the single most important thing in

building a business in building a

company is hiring the definition of the

word company is actually group of people

and that is the first responsibility and

job that any entrepreneur has and should

focus on but surprisingly most don't

about 80% of my team have been hired

from LinkedIn and I think there's very

few platforms if any in the world that

could give you that diversity of

candidate with that much information and

data on their profiles it usually costs

money but for the entrepreneurs that are

listening to me I've got you a free job

ad post for your company on LinkedIn

just go to linkedin.com

doac to post your free job ad today

that's linkedin.com doac terms and

conditions

apply what about lying this is one of

the most um things people are most

interested in is how to everyone wants

to spot a liar it's funny cuz like the

the rest of our conversation one could

infer that as how to like be a liar I'm

joking on no but it is it's like how to

show up in a certain way to get success

in a certain context whether it's dating

or work whatever yeah but then we want

to figure out if someone's playing us is

there is it possible to spot a liar most

people can only spot a lie with 54%

accuracy they've actually studied the

average person is very bad better you're

better off tossing a coin 54% accuracy

we are very bad at spotting lers and

this is important to know about yourself

is we should not overestimate our

ability to spot Lies We are usually not

good at it so it is very important to

give someone the benefit of the doubt

because you don't know it's very hard to

spot it is possible there are certain

statistical cues to deceit there are

cues that over and over again research

find Liars typically do but not always

like there's no Pinocchio's nose there's

no one cue that means someone is lying

but there are a couple cues that come up

over and over again one we already

talked about the question inflection

it's very suspicious if someone someone

is speaking and all of a sudden they ask

a

question if they're not actually asking

a question right like if all of a sudden

you hear the question inflection use on

a statement or a number or a boundary or

a timeline that's when I'm like let's

double click on that for a second and

talk about that budget so you mentioned

the number was 500,000 where does that

number come from let's talk about more

and I want to hear if I'm going to hear

it again interesting so that's a double

click for me that's like let's make sure

that I heard that right let's make sure

that you feel confident about it let

where does that come from so that's just

a little red flag that says dive deeper

nothing is a sign of lying it's just a

sign that you should dig deeper so uh

question reflection a volume drop is

another vocal cue of deception so when

we're anxious or nervous we will lose

volume and we lose breath so if you hear

someone who's speaking I I hear this a

lot in sales calls so someone will um I

always know what part of a sales

presentation makes my entrepreneurs the

most nervous because they lose volume

during that part of their presentation

so it sounds like this so let's move on

to our team so our founding partners are

um me myself uh Joe Jimmy and we all met

at

NYU and we're going to now talk about

like I'm obvious I'm making it obvious

for you but if you're listening for it

you'll hear where someone is like they

literally lost fuel they literally lost

breath so a sudden drop in volume it's a

very interesting CU to like double click

like what just happened there how do you

feel about your co- under how long have

you known each other anything we should

know about that how's the relationship

how do you fight how do you communicate

right like that's when I would that's

where I would aim most of my investor

questions if I was hearing that volume

drop on that specific

area the other the now that's fcal

non-verbal so non-verbal what you're

looking for is in congruencies where the

verbal does not match the body the

biggest and most obvious one is when

someone says yes but shakes their head

no or says no but shakes their head yes

so I might say to my daughter did you

clean your room um yeah I did she's

shaking her head no in Western cultur so

the there's a cultural exception to this

one India Bulgaria and Pakistan they

knot a little bit differently the

research actually shows that but in

countries outside of India Bulgaria and

Pakistan when we agree with someone say

yes or telling the truth we typically

agree with ourselves and Shake our heads

yes when we don't agree or don't like

something we often Shake our heads no we

can sometimes also do this in disbelief

like wow I cannot believe that just

happened so I'm always looking for in

congruent nods this happens a lot if you

ask someone do you like the new

girl yeah you know she's um

great right you see that 100% yeah all

the time and people they don't realize

they're doing it but they're shaking

their head no they do not like that

person you'll also see this with

mismatched facial expressions and the

biggest one for liars the research finds

is disgust so disgust is a expression

that people make without even realizing

it and this is across cultures when we

don't like something or we smell

something bad we crinkle our nose up and

we Flash the upper whites of our teeth

and we go uh that so I you'll notice

that Liars typically feel dirty when

they lie so oftentimes they'll show

disgust with themselves for lying so

you'll ask someone so what do you think

of the proposal yeah um

it's really

good and they might even sniff really

yeah what's a

sniff um what do it signal oh it's it's

a it's a it's a disgust activator like

when we are disgusted our nasal cavities

want to close because we want to take in

less of it and so even though it's not

about food it's about a preference Liars

will often show a little bit of disgust

when they are lying because they are

like a little bit disgusted with

themselves and so you'll see this

activation here by the way no one does

that naturally like right this is a very

unnatural to hold my face but we do it

when we feel disgusted it's a the nasal

cavities when we we nasal dilate our

nasal Wings dilate that's what it's

called like these nasal Wings dilate and

we begin to scrunch them up it's like

we're don't like what we're seeing

smelling hearing so what I will do is I

will share a proposal to someone I will

talk about something and I watch for any

disgust so I'll say you know here's the

plan for 2025 here's what we're going to

do and if I see

[Music]

a I know that that team member or that

person is like not that into it and

that's why I double click any questions

how do you feel Stephen do you like this

idea yeah I love it yeah no horrible

horrible you look like you're about to

throw up by the way I heard you I heard

you say that the most toxic

relationships are the ambivalent

relationships the word ambivalent means

to what does it mean okay so ambivalent

is actually not toxic so toxic is like

we know it's bad we don't want it we're

creating boundaries around it ambivalent

means

we're not sure ambivalent relationships

are the relationships in your life that

are the most damaging they're the

relationships where you wonder does she

like me do I like her g i I wish she

would cancel this dinner we have am I

tired after that I'm dreading it do I

have to go gosh I wish I was home those

are ambivalent relationships where

you're not sure and they are so

energetically draining because a toxic

person you know they're toxic you're

like I don't like that person they're

not serving me I'm not going out dinner

I'm going home no thanks not going to

text you not going to tell you I'm

thinking about you where an ambivalent

person you're like I should check in

with that person I really should go to

the dinner oh it's been five months

since I've gone din with oh man do I

even know what they're up to these days

do I even care and then most importantly

do they like me do they support me

that's why I asked about that friend

that you were like unsure about I was

like are they jealous do they have a

problem with you because you might be

picking up on they are ambivalent

towards you and that is you're picking

up on that there's a research study that

was done with police officers and they

wanted to know what makes for a thriving

workplace so they asked police officers

to rank the people in their Precinct and

they found that the police officers who

had the most ambivalent ties were more

unhappy in their job had less work life

balance had more workplace dress more

than the people who had toxic

relationships in other words the police

officers who said all 10 of those people

are toxic we're happier at work and the

police officer who said I don't know if

I like that person and that person I

don't know if that person likes me I

don't know if I want to go out to lunch

with that person again I kind of would

rather be alone because it is so

mentally draining to have ambivalent

relationships so it's really important

if you're making that list of people

going back to the very beginning you

know the people you're really close not

very close with kind of close with

really close with if you're not sure put

them at the bottom and in the next 30

days try to ask them the questions that

we shared working on anything exciting

what's your biggest goal right now and

see if you like their answers it's

important to either move them up or move

them out don't let them be ambivalent

one of the things that is highly

searched on Google I was looking at

Google to figure out um what the most

search questions are there's some tools

that I use to to figure out what those

what people want to know and one of them

was just Fally how do I start a

conversation so what my next book is

about out so I'm happy to hear that okay

one is don't overthink your opener

starting a conversation is like hey I'm

Vanessa like literally your opener can

just be that my sister my youngest

sister I was she was like the best

advice I ever gave her ever and I was

like what is it she was like is you just

told me to say hello to people and that

is it your opener is just hey I'm

Vanessa hey nice to meet you so don't

overthink the opener because that opener

your body is actually doing a lot of

things your brain and body are like

competence warmth facial expression

voice Tone If you're like what's your

biggest goal in

life it's it's way too much and so one

is your opener should actually be basic

so the other person's brain is like

gives them a chance to like safe okay

friend we're friend hey how are you

doing right I I my friend Q I held up my

hand so don't overthink your opener hey

nice to meet you hey I'm Vanessa your

first question is where things get more

interesting okay so if you don't know

their name you want to say like oh

what's your name great I'm Vanessa then

you have a choice

and I like to take the better route you

can say so what do you do but I really

don't like that path it's autopilot so

what I like to do instead is ask a

version of the excitement question do

anything fun and exciting this past

weekend if it's a Monday so Mondays I

always ask you do anything fun this past

weekend Fridays I always ask have any

exciting plans coming up this weekend

and then Tuesday Wednesday Thursday I

don't talk to

anyone what is the most important thing

we haven't talked about that we should

have talked about for the person side at

home the typical question most prolific

question that you get there's one story

that I love that I try to keep front of

mind which is about Harry S Truman

former US president most people don't

know about him is that he was actually

severely introverted and when most

people think about US presidents they do

not think about introverts in fact most

presidents have to be kind of a booming

extrovert personality and he was very

introverted and he did something very

interesting at the Democratic National

Convention back in I believe 1944

um he knew he was not a good public

speaker which also is very rare for US

president to become president without

being a good public speaker he knew he

could not cut it on stage with the very

charismatic people and he was not he was

behind in the polls he was not the

preferred candidate so he was like I'm

not going to compete on stage I'm not

going to try to outspeak them I'm not

going to try to go work the floor and

shake hands it's not my way what I am

going to do is try to find a way to do

what I'm best at which is one-on-one

conversations where I can win people

over with an argument

so in the Democratic National Convention

it was really hot in Chicago in the

middle of summer he rented the one air

conditioned room in the bottom in the

basement of the convention center and

one by one his team would invite person

by person down into that air condition

room and he would tell them his story he

would tell them his points and vote by

vote and as the votes were being tallied

he would win over every single person

that went to that room one it was air

conditioned so they wanted to stay there

as long as possible two he would hear

what are your concerns why do you not

want to vote for me and he would explain

to them why they should vote for him and

vote by vote he ended up winning the

National Convention without having to

speak on stage barely at all I share

this because stop competing on stages

where you can't be your best start

creating rooms where you can think about

what are your social strengths you have

one what is it is it storytelling is it

being funny is it listening is it being

empathetic is it being a decoder is it

being persuasive what is your social

strength create spaces and rooms where

you can exercise that strength because

no one wants you to pretend to be an

extrovert or pretend to be something

that you're good at that you're not it's

much better to be do what you're

actually good at and attract the right

people and your social strength might

not be in person might not be and that's

okay like there are some people who are

great at texting there are some people

who are great at sending voice notes

there are some people who make their

friends by broadcasting and then picking

out a couple people that's how you met

your girlfriend is you broadcasted she

resonated with something that you said

and you gave her the way to find you she

did and then you met so maybe it's

broadcasting I think we have to think

outside the box it's not only in person

there's so many ways you can have social

strengths I've heard it all now yeah I

get it I believe it I'm into it yeah

what is step one I'm going to buy your

books there's two of them here so I'm

going to buy both of these books both of

them will be linked below what else can

I do to start on my journey of becoming

you you were a recovering awkward person

you before now you're not yes what's

step one okay step number one is begin

to break autopilot so make a commitment

for the next 30 days you are not going

to trigger autopilot in your

conversation no more what do you do no

more how are you no more where are you

from no more okay right ask better

questions okay what's your biggest goal

we can anything exciting you're

disgusting me no I'm thinking I'm just I

was tell you look

good okay so that's challenge number one

Challenge number two find out where you

fall in the warmth and competence scale

are you highly warmed do you need to

dial up competence to be taken more

seriously are you highly confident you

need dial up warm to be seen as more

like a and friendly and trustworthy do

that email audit so take the quiz then

do the email audit and then if you can

here's the bonus challenge send the

Charisma quiz to someone who knows you

well someone at work maybe a partner ask

them to take it as you and screenshot

their results sometimes how we perceive

our warmth and competence is not how

others perceive our warmth and

competence so if you take it and you say

I'm perfect I'm a I'm a five of five but

they take it and they see you as really

high on the warmth scale that is going

to be critical feedback for you we have

a closing tradition on this podcast

where the last guest leaves a question

for the next guest not knowing who

they're going to be leaving it for and

the question that's been left for

you I always love

these when in your life did you try to

outrun your pain and what was the

consequence when in your life did you

turn and face your pain and what was the

consequence

there was a really weird moment in my

career where everything was taking off I

had a lot of years of not of a lot of

hard struggle and being a writer I had a

a published book traditionally published

book that completely failed 2011 we

won't name it put it out there thought

my world would change and it did

terribly I got terrible reviews it

didn't sell and I was literally told

you'll never write a book again and I

was just

devastated

devastated and my husband was like you

got to you got to keep writing you're a

writer you got to keep writing and so I

went back to it I started science of

people that was officially when I

started like the actual website science

people kept writing and then it started

taking off I had video videos that went

viral we started having millions of

visitors on the website and I wanted to

prove myself very badly and I wanted to

erase that painful memory and so when I

got approached to write

Captivate I was like

no I can't write books I'm I'm a

YouTuber and a blogger but I can't write

books and she was like this will be a

different kind of book this will be a

book about really what you want to say

to people not the book you think you

should write and I was like no I was

like I cannot do it it's too painful I

will not survive if that fails I will

not survive if that fails and it took

Nikki months of telling me this will be

different this will be a different kind

of book you can write the real book that

you really want to write and so I said

yes I started writing it and that was

when I think I I don't know how end the

question was but decided it would be

worth the pain if that failed it would

be worth the pain of at least saying

that I tried that was a very hard Choice

thank goodness it did not fail he did

really well um and I'm eternally

grateful for that when everyone when

anyone buys a copy I'm like one click

further from that

failure horrible failure Vanessa thank

you thank you so much

um what you write about and what you

educate people on is a subject that's

probably more important now than ever

and I say that because of the sort of

macro climate of society where we're

more lonely than ever we're struggling

with connection it's not coming

naturally to us as it once probably did

or at least more natural than it than it

does now and so many the it's crazy I've

only been a podcaster really I think for

about four years like I think I started

in 2017 but really it's been four years

since I've been uploading and it's crazy

just in that time alone how many more of

the questions I'm getting are about all

the things you write about they're about

like how to make a friend and how to

show up in a certain way and all these

kinds of things so what the work you're

doing is so unbelievably important

there's so much more that needs to be

done as well but but the contribution

you've had to the 400,000 people that

you've taught and the millions of people

that have bought these books and

consumed your videos and everything is a

really really important one than so

thank you it's so funny because even me

like like people I people see me on

camera and stuff but I learned so much

so much from your work so much thank you

so much so many things as well that that

I that I think a lot about and you know

things you can take or Leave You got to

say like who do I want to be and like

who am I you know truly to then apply

these things because there's no point

like I just have no interest in building

a facade or anything but there's things

about me which I H I didn't even

know I was doing that you know yeah and

like what kind of friend do I want to be

what kind of partner do I want to be

what kind of way do I want to be in

conversation like you get to choose

Thank you Vanessa thanks for having me

when it comes to food I trust my gut and

I trust Zoe a business I'm an investor

in and today's sponsor of this podcast

information is out there when it comes

to food take healthy Halos the claims

you see on packaging that say things

like low sugar and nothing artificial

are often a sign of foods to avoid have

you ever noticed a health claim on fresh

fruit you probably get my point

understandably there's loads of distrust

out there who should you turn to for

accurate information I U Zoey which is

backed by one of the world's largest

microbiome databases and most
